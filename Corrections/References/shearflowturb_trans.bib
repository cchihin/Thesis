	abstract = {The linear, nonlinear and breakdown stages in the transition of localized disturbances in plane Poiseuille flow is studied by direct numerical simulations and analysis of the linearized Navier–Stokes equations. Three-dimensionality plays a key role and allows for algebraic growth of the normal vorticity through the linear
              lift-up
              mechanism. This growth primarily generates elongated structures in the streamwise direction since it is largest at low streamwise wavenumbers. For finite-amplitude disturbances such structures will be generated essentially independent of the details of the initial disturbance, since the preferred nonlinear interactions transfer energy to low streamwise wavenumbers. The nonlinear interactions also give a decrease in the spanwise scales. For the stronger initial disturbances the streamwise vorticity associated with the slightly inclined streaks was found to roll up into distinct streamwise vortices in the vicinity of which breakdown occurred. The breakdown starts with a local rapid growth of the normal velocity bringing low-speed fluid out from the wall. This phenomenon is similar to the low-velocity spikes previously observed in transition experiments. Soon thereafter a small turbulent spot is formed. This scenario represents a
              bypass
              of the regular Tollmien–Schlichting, secondary instability process. The simulations have been carried out with a sufficient spatial resolution to ensure an accurate description of all stages of the breakdown and spot formation processes. The generality of the observed processes is substantiated by use of different types of initial disturbances and by Blasius boundary-layer simulations. The present results point in the direction of universality of the observed transition mechanisms for localized disturbances in wall-bounded shear flows.},

The 2-D steady flow loses stability to three-dimensional (3-D) eigenmodes at Rec=230, βc=1.3 for ρ=0.086 and Rec≈550, βc≈1.5 for ρ=0.043, where β is the spanwise wave number and 2ρ is the height of the ribbon. For ρ=0.086, the bifurcation is determined to be subcritical by calculating the cubic term in the normal form equation from the time series of a single nonlinear simulation; steady 3-D flows are found for Re as low as 200. The critical eigenmode and nonlinear 3-D states contain streamwise vortices localized near the ribbon, whose streamwise extent increases with Re.

For the Reynolds numbers lower than 80 with a large computational domain of 51.2 × 2 × 22.5, the turbulent puff was observed and its signiﬁcant inﬂuences on the momentum and heat transports were found. The spatial structure of the equilibrium puff, or the localized turbulence, was examined with taking account of two different thermal boundary conditions: the uniform heat-ﬂux heating and the constant temperature difference between the walls. It was revealed that there existed a localized strong turbulent region in the form of an oblique band, along which a spanwise secondary ﬂow was induced. In consequence, at the present lowest Reynolds number as low as 60, the ﬂow remained turbulent and the larger Nusselt numbers than those without puff was obtained by the presence of puff.},

When the Reynolds number was decreased to 60 with small computational box size, the flow became laminar. Using a large box, we found that a localized turbulence was observed to sustain in the form of periodic oblique band. This type of locally disordered flow is similar to a equilibrium turbulent puff in a transitional pipe flow. Various turbulence statistics such as turbulence intensities, vorticity fluctuations and Reynolds stresses are provided. Especially, their near-wall asymptotic behavior and budget terms of turbulence kinetic energy were discussed with respect to the Reynolds-number dependence and an influence of the computational box size.

Simulations for 2300 ⩾ Reb ⩾ 700 show the gradual development from uniform turbulence to a pattern with wavelength 20 half-gaps at Reb ≈ 1900, to a pattern with wavelength 40 at Reb ≈ 1300 and finally to laminar flow at Reb ≈ 800. These transitions are tracked quantitatively via diagnostics using the amplitude and phase of the Fourier transform and its probability distribution. The propagation velocity of the pattern is approximately that of the mean flux and is a decreasing function of Reynolds number. Examination of the time-averaged flow shows that a turbulent band is associated with two counter-rotating cells stacked in the cross-channel direction and that the turbulence is highly concentrated near the walls. Near the wall, the Reynolds stress force accelerates the fluid through a turbulent band while viscosity decelerates it; advection by the laminar profile acts in both directions. In the center, the Reynolds stress force decelerates the fluid through a turbulent band while advection by the laminar profile accelerates it. These characteristics are compared with those of turbulent-laminar banded patterns in plane Couette flow.},

            Shear flows undergo a sudden transition from laminar to turbulent motion as the velocity increases, and the onset of turbulence radically changes transport efficiency and mixing properties. Even for the well-studied case of pipe flow, it has not been possible to determine at what Reynolds number the motion will be either persistently turbulent or ultimately laminar. We show that in pipes, turbulence that is transient at low Reynolds numbers becomes sustained at a distinct critical point. Through extensive experiments and computer simulations, we were able to identify and characterize the processes ultimately responsible for sustaining turbulence. In contrast to the classical Landau-Ruelle-Takens view that turbulence arises from an increase in the temporal complexity of fluid motion, here, spatial proliferation of chaotic domains is the decisive process and intrinsic to the nature of fluid turbulence.},

In a range of bulk mean Reynolds number Re = 1700-2000, the turbulent stripe was observed to be inclined at angles of 20-30 degree against the streamwise direction, and its streamwise wave length was about 60 times of the channel half width (\$δ\$). The longitudinal streaks with the spanwise spacing of 1.6\$δ\$ were found in the quasi-laminar regions. The critical Reynolds number was Re = 1300. Time traces of the streamwise velocity were measured by laser Doppler velocimetry, revealing similarity to the equilibrium turbulent puff in the transitional pipe flow.},

	abstract = {Wall-bounded shear flows transitioning to turbulence may self-organize into alternating turbulent and laminar regions forming a stripe pattern with non-trivial oblique orientation. Different experiments and flow simulations identify oblique stripe patterns as the preferred solution of the well-known Navier-Stokes equations, but the origin of stripes and their oblique orientation remains unexplained. In concluding his lectures, Feynman highlights the unexplained stripe pattern hidden in the solution space of the Navier-Stokes equations as an example demonstrating the need for improved theoretical tools to analyze the fluid flow equations. Here we exploit dynamical systems methods and demonstrate the existence of an exact equilibrium solution of the fully nonlinear 3D Navier-Stokes equations that resembles oblique stripe patterns in plane Couette flow. The stripe equilibrium emerges from the well-studied Nagata equilibrium and exists only for a limited range of pattern angles. This suggests a mechanism selecting the non-trivial oblique orientation angle of turbulent-laminar stripes.},

Localized perturbations can evolve into isolated turbulent bands by continuously growing obliquely when the Reynolds number is larger than 660. However, interactions with other bands and local perturbations cause band breaking and decay. The competition between the band extension and breaking does not lead to a sustained turbulence until Re becomes larger than about 1000. Above this critical value, the bands split, providing an effective mechanism for turbulence spreading.},

              . Our results show that the downstream end of the band features fast streak generation and travels into the adjacent laminar flow, whereas streaks at the upstream end decay continually and more slowly. This asymmetry is responsible for the transverse growth of the band. We particularly investigated the mechanism of streak generation at the downstream end, which drives the growth of the band. We identified a spanwise inflectional instability associated with the local mean flow near the downstream end, and our results strongly suggest that this instability is responsible for the streak generation and ultimately for the growth of the band. Based on our study, we propose a possible self-sustaining mechanism of fully localised turbulent bands at low Reynolds numbers in channel flow.},
