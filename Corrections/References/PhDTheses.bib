	abstract = {In this thesis I report on work stimulated by experimental discoveries in the last few years of spiral patterns in Rayleigh-Benard convection. Specifically, recent observations have included both individual, rotating spirals as well as a spatio-temporally chaotic state called 'spiral defect chaos' (SDC), in which numerous spirals of various sizes form, interact, and disintegrate. The work presented herein has concentrated on quantifying the dynamics of the individual spirals in order to produce new insights into the state of SDC. Specifically, in following one recent line of theoretical work, we have measured the velocities and background wavenumbers of the outer defects in the individual spirals to see whether the dynamics are describable by wavenumber selection mechanisms. I further report on the dynamics of multi-arm spirals, which show, in addition to the overall spiral rotation observed in single-arm spirals, a complicated inner core behavior. The general array of patterns (and the transitions from one to the other) within cylindrical convection cells are also presented. In a separate investigation, the preference of convective patterns for a state of SDC versus one of straight rolls has been explored. I also detail the experimental apparatus used to conduct the experiments.},

	abstract = {Presented work brings new results to numerical computations of ﬂow inﬂuenced by temperature changes. Constructed numerical algorithm takes into account variable coeﬃcients of the diﬀerential operators in the system of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations coupled with thermal heat equation. The spatial discretisation of the problem targets to application of high order method, the spectral element method. Phenomenons connected with high order approximations are discussed on a number of examples and comparisons with methods of lower order, which are more common. Results were achieved for two ﬂuids with opposite response to heating, air and water. The observed quantity is particularly a frequency of vortex shedding, the Strouhal number, as dependent on temperature and Reynolds number. The calculated values were compared with experimental results and exhibit a good coincidence. Numerical analysis of separation angle in ﬂow around heated circular cylinder may give a new impulse to veriﬁcation of accuracy and reliability of the developed method.},

These methods have superior numerical accuracy over low-order methods due to their use of piecewise polynomial representations of domains and solutions. As such they are viewed as a potential source of higher ﬁdelity simulations with a view of industrial application [81]. The current state of the art in high-order mesh generation does not provide a reliable and eﬃcient approach which would be required in an industrial setting.},

	abstract = {In this thesis, we have introduced a 3D integration method. This parallel-line, omnidirectional integration procedure (Omni3D) calculates the pressure at every point by integration from all directions. To reduce the computational costs, the calculations are performed by a GPU-based algorithm, which determines the 3D pressure field from tomographic PIV data in 1 min. The accuracy of Omni3D is compared to that of several techniques, including procedures based on solving the Pressure Poisson Equation (PPE). The error analysis is based on Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data for isotropic turbulence, synthetic 3D PIV images for turbulent channel flow generated from DNS data. For acceleration fields with low errors and properly specified boundary conditions, Omni3D and PPE give similar results. However, Omni3D is more effective in suppressing the effects of acceleration errors. Omni3D could be further improved by avoiding high error regions using e.g. giving weight to the integration path by Omni3D-Weighted method or terminating certain integration paths by Omni3D-Selected method.},
