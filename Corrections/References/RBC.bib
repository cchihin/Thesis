	abstract = {This paper examines the stability in viscous liquid of a steady regime in which the temperature decreases with uniform gradient between a lower horizontal surface which is heated and an upper horizontal surface which is cooled. The problem has been treated both experimentally and theoretically by Bénard , Brunt, Jeffreys, Low and Rayleigh , and it is known that in stability will occur at some critical value of

              Ap/pkv,
              h
              denoting the thickness of the fluid layer,
              Ap/p
              the fractional excess of density in the fluid at the top as compared with the fluid at the bottom surface,
              k
              the diffusivity and
              v
              the kinematic viscosity. The critical value depends upon the conditions at the top and bottom surfaces, which may be either ‘free ’or constrained by rigid conducting surfaces. The theoretical problem is solved here under three distinct boundary conditions, and greater generality than before is maintained in regard to the ‘cell pattern’ which occurs in plan. In addition an approximate method is described and illustrated, depending on a stationary property akin to that of which Lord Rayleigh made wide application in vibration theory. Within the assumptions of the approximate theory (i.e. with neglect of terms of the second order in respect of the velocities) a particular size is associated with every shape of cell (such that ‘
              a
              2
              ’ takes a preferred value), but no particular shape is more likely than another to occur in a layer of indefinite extent (§ 31'). The explanation of the apparent preference for a hexagonal cell pattern (§5) must presumably be sought in a theory which takes account of second-order terms. This conjecture if correct goes some way towards explaining the rather indefinite nature of observed cell-formations (cf. Low 1930, figure 10).},

	abstract = {When a layer of fluid is heated uniformly from below and cooled from above, a cellular regime of steady convection is set u p at values of the Rayleigh number exceeding a critical value. A method is presented here to determine the form and amplitude of this convection. T h e non-linear equations describing the fields of motion and temperature are expanded in a sequence of inhomogeneous linear equations dependent upon the solutions of the linear stability problem. We find that there are an infinite number of steady-state finite amplitude solutions (having different horizontal plan-forms) which formally satisfy these equations. A criterion for ' relative stability ' is deduced which selects as the realized solution that one which has the maximum mean-square temperature gradient. Particular conclusions are that for a large Prandtl number the amplitude of the convection is determined primarily by the distortion of the distribution of mean temperature and only secondarily by the self-distortion of the disturbance, and that when the Prandtl number is less than unity self-distortion plays the dominant role in amplitude determination. T h einitial heat transport due to convection depends linearly on the Rayleigh number ; the heat transport at higher Rayleigh numbers departs only slightly from this linear dependence. Square horizontal plan-forms are preferred to hexagonal plan-forms in ordinary fluids with symmetric boundary conditions. The proposed finite amplitude method is applicable to any model of shear flow or convection with a soluble stability problem.},

It was found necessary to include not only viscosity but also heat conductivity to preclude the resulting differential equation from having a singularity. Asymptotic solutions of the sixth-order differential equation thus derived are obtained. They show the presence of a Stokes point. The limiting form of the differential equation near the Stokes point is next obtained and an exact solution of this equation is derived by means of a Laplace transformation. In the general case the integrand of the Laplace transformation involves Whittaker's confluent hypergeometric functions. In the special case of a Prandtl number of 1, the integrand is considerably simpler and for this case asymptotic representations of the solutions on both sides of the Stokes point have been derived from the Laplace transformation solution by the method of steepest descent. The connection formulas between the solutions are the same as that previously derived by Tollmien and Lin for the case when stratification, gravity, and heat conduction are neglected.},

	abstract = {An experimental study of the response of a thin uniformly heated rotating layer of fluid is presented. It is shown that the stability of the fluid depends strongly upon the three parameters that described its state, namely the Rayleigh number, the Taylor number and the Prandtl number. For the two Prandtl numbers considered, 6·8 and 0·025 corresponding to water and mercury, linear theory is insufficient to fully describe their stability properties. For water, subcritical instability will occur for all Taylor numbers greater than 5 × 10
              4
              , whereas mercury exhibits a subcritical instability only for finite Taylor numbers less than 10
              5
              . At all other Taylor numbers there is good agreement between linear theory and experiment.
            
            
              The heat flux in these two fluids has been measured over a wide range of Rayleigh and Taylor numbers. Generally, much higher Nusselt numbers are found with water than with mercury. In water, at any Rayleigh number greater than 10
              4
              , it is found that the Nusselt number will increase by about 10\% as the Taylor number is increased from zero to a certain value, which depends on the Rayleigh number. It is suggested that this increase in the heat flux results from a perturbation of the velocity boundary layer with an ‘Ekman-layer-like’ profile in such a way that the scale of boundary layer is reduced. In mercury, on the other hand, the heat flux decreases monotonically with increasing Taylor number. Over a range of Rayleigh numbers (at large Taylor numbers) oscillatory convection is preferred although it is inefficient at transporting heat. Above a certain Rayleigh number, less than the critical value for steady convection according to linear theory, the heat flux increases more rapidly and the convection becomes increasingly irregular as is shown by the temperature fluctuations at a point in the fluid.
            
            Photographs of the convective flow in a silicone oil (Prandtl number = 100) at various rotation rates are shown. From these a rough estimate is obtained of the dominant horizontal convective scale as a function of the Rayleigh and Taylor numbers.},

	abstract = {The instabilities of two-dimensional convection rolls in a horizontal fluid layer heated from below are investigated in the case when the Prandtl number is seven or lower. Two new mechanisms of instability are described theoretically as well as experimentally. The knot instability causes the transition to spoke-pattern convection at higher Rayleigh numbers while the skewed varicose instability accomplishes a change to larger horizontal wavelengths of the convection rolls. Both instabilities disappear in the limits of small and large Prandtl number. Although the experimental methods fail in realizing closely the infinitely conducting boundaries assumed in the theory, the observations agree in all qualitative aspects with the theoretical predictions.},

The heat transport measurements have a resolution of better than 0.1\%, and the shadowgraph technique can detect the flow field for E = (R - R , ) / R , as small as lo-’ ( R , is the critical value of the Rayleigh number R for onset of convection). The apparatus and procedures were used to study pattern and wavenumber evolution in a cylindrical layer of water with radius-to-height ratio L = 7.5 and Prandtl number U = 6.1. We found that dynamic sidewall forcing during the early thermal transients after a change in the heat current from a subcritical to a supercritical value establishes a cylindrical flow pattern. Once created, this pattern is stable in our apparatus over the wide range 0.16 5 e 5 8 even after the transients have decayed.},

the no-motion state up to 14.5 times the critical Rayleigh number. We characterize 
the robustness of the controller with respect to parameter uncertainties, unmodelled

The nonlinear behaviour is investigated near the onset of convection using an 
eigenfunction expansion. It is found that initially a steady target pattern develops; 
the number of rolls depends only on the aspect ratio of the box. At about 5\% 
beyond onset, an oscillatory pattern develops, in which the number of rolls oscillates 
between two adjacent values. The transitions between the initial steady state and this 
oscillatory pattern are also investigated, and fall into two main categories. As the 
Rayleigh number is reduced to the transition point, either the period of the travelling 
wave tends to infinity, whilst its amplitude stays finite, or there is a sudden transition 
to a vascillating pattern, the amplitude of which becomes smaller and finally vanishes, 
whilst the period remains finite. The results are compared with experimental work.},

Rectangular and cylindrical geometries of varying aspect ratios for experimental boundary conditions, including ﬁns and spatial ramps in plate separation, are examined with particular attention paid to the role of the mean ﬂow. A small cylindrical convection layer bounded laterally either by a rigid wall, ﬁn, or a ramp is investigated and our results suggest that the mean ﬂow plays an important role in the observed wavenumber. Analytical results are developed quantifying the mean ﬂow sources, generated by amplitude gradients, and its effect on the pattern wavenumber for a large-aspect-ratio cylinder with a ramped boundary. Numerical results are found to agree well with these analytical predictions. We gain further insight into the role of mean ﬂow in pattern dynamics by employing a novel method of quenching the mean ﬂow numerically. Simulations of a spiral defect chaos state where the mean ﬂow is suddenly quenched is found to remove the time dependence, increase the wavenumber and make the pattern more angular in nature.},

	abstract = {A new technique giving significant drag reduction in turbulent shear flows has been proposed by using the buoyancy effect to generate periodic spanwise motion. Such spanwise motion can be obtained by arranging heating and cooling strips periodically aligned in the spanwise direction of a vertical channel, where the streamwise mean flow is perpendicular to the gravity vector. The strip size has been changed in order to obtain the optimum size corresponding to the maximum drag reduction. Series of direct numerical simulation have been performed where the bulk Reynolds number, Rem=Umδ∕ν is fixed at 2270 whereas the Grashof number is changed to between 106 and 107. At the lowest Grashof number, the buoyancy forces are not strong enough to disturb the flow and no apparent variation of drag compared to the plane channel is observed. However, as the Grashof number increases, considerable drag reduction can be obtained. At the highest Grashof number, an optimum strip size of about 250 wall units gives drag reduction of about 35\%. The greater the Grashof number, the smaller the strip size which attains the maximum drag reduction. The similarity between the induced lateral motions by the buoyancy forces and those induced by the spanwise wall oscillations is highlighted.},

              Natural convection in an infinite horizontal layer subject to periodic heating along the lower wall has been investigated using a combination of numerical and asymptotic techniques. The heating maintains the same mean temperatures at both walls while producing sinusoidal temperature variations along one horizontal direction, with its spatial distribution characterized by the wavenumber
              
                
                  
                  \${\textbackslash}alpha \$

              . The primary response of the system takes the form of stationary convection consisting of rolls with the axis orthogonal to the heating wave vector and structure determined by the particular values of

              convection is limited to a thin layer adjacent to the lower wall with a uniform conduction zone emerging above it; the temperature in this zone becomes independent of the heating pattern and varies in the vertical direction only. Linear stability of the above system has been considered and conditions leading to the emergence of secondary convection have been identified. Secondary convection gives rise to either longitudinal rolls, transverse rolls or oblique rolls at the onset, depending on

              . The longitudinal rolls are parallel to the primary rolls and the transverse rolls are orthogonal to the primary rolls, and both result in striped patterns. The oblique rolls lead to the formation of convection cells with aspect ratio dictated by their inclination angle and formation of rhombic patterns. Two mechanisms of instability have been identified. In the case of

              , parametric resonance dominates and leads to a pattern of instability that is locked in with the pattern of heating according to the relation

              and the fluid response becoming similar to that found in the case of a uniformly heated wall. Competition between these mechanisms gives rise to non-commensurable states in the case of longitudinal rolls and the appearance of soliton lattices, to the formation of distorted transverse rolls, and to the appearance of the wave vector component in the direction perpendicular to the forcing direction. A rapid stabilization is observed when the heating wavenumber is reduced below

They are uncovered when the turbulent fields are averaged in time and turbulent fluctuations are thus removed. We apply the Boussinesq closure to estimate turbulent viscosities and diffusivities, respectively. The resulting turbulent Rayleigh number \$Ra\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\}\$, that describes the convection of the mean patterns, is indeed in the spiral defect chaos range. The turbulent Prandtl numbers are smaller than one with \$0.2{\textbackslash}le Pr\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\}{\textbackslash}le 0.4\$ for Prandtl numbers \$0.7 {\textbackslash}le Pr{\textbackslash}le 10\$.

Thermal forcing has been employed using both streamwise and transverse arrays of heated strips on the bottom wall of the channel. The simulations have been carried out for a ﬁxed friction Reynolds number Reτ = 180 with friction Richardson number Riτ varying from 15 to 30. The periodic transverse strips exhibited an increase in skin-friction drag with a decrease in the width of hot strips though wider hot strips exhibit a slight decrease in skin-friction drag. Streamwise periodic strips exhibited a reduction in skin-friction drag of the order of 8\% with an increasing trend in reduction of friction drag with increasing Riτ . The mechanism responsible for turbulent skin-friction drag reduction due to streamwise thermal forcing affects two processes, namely: (a) advection of streamwise kinetic energy from the buffer-layer to outer layer by the wall-normal buoyancy forces leading to formation of broader low-speed streaks over the heated regions and (b) brings about suppression of cross-ﬂow ﬂuctuating velocities which in turn weakens the transient growth of the turbulent streaks.},

	abstract = {In this work, an in house topology optimization (TO) solver is developed to optimize a conjugate heat transfer problem: realizing more complex and efficient coolant systems by minimizing pressure losses and maximizing the heat transfer. The TO method consists in an idealized sedimentation process in which a design variable, in this case impermeability, is iteratively updated across the domain. The optimal solution is the solidified region uniquely defined by the final distribution of impermeability. Due to the geometrical complexity of the optimal solutions obtained, this design method is not always suitable for classic manufacturing methods (molding, stamping....) On the contrary, it can be thought as an approach to better and fully exploit the flexibility offered by additive manufacturing (AM), still often used on old and less efficient design techniques. In the present article, the proposed method is developed using a Lagrangian optimization approach to minimize stagnation pressure dissipation while maximizing heat transfer between fluid and solid region. An impermeability dependent thermal conductivity is included and a smoother operator is adopted to bound thermal diffusivity gradients across solid and fluid. Simulations are performed on a straight squared duct domain. The variability of the results is shown on the basis of different weights of the objective functions. The solver builds automatically three-dimensional structures enhancing the heat transfer level between the walls and the flow through the generation of pairs of counter rotating vortices. This is consistent to solution proposed in literature like v-shaped ribs, even if the geometry generated is more complex and more efficient. It is possible to define the desired level of heat transfer and losses and obtain the closest optimal solution. It is the first time that a conjugate heat transfer optimization problem, with these constraints, has been tackled with this approach for three-dimensional geometries.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of optimizing heat transport through an incompressible ﬂuid layer. Modeling passive scalar transport by advection-diffusion, we maximize the mean rate of total transport by a divergence-free velocity ﬁeld. Subject to various boundary conditions and intensity constraints, we prove that the maximal rate of transport scales linearly in the r.m.s. kinetic energy and, up to possible logarithmic corrections, as the one-third power of the mean enstrophy in the advective regime. This makes rigorous a previous prediction on the near optimality of convection rolls for energy-constrained transport. On the other hand, optimal designs for enstrophy-constrained transport are signiﬁcantly more difﬁcult to describe: we introduce a “branching” ﬂow design with an unbounded number of degrees of freedom and prove it achieves nearly optimal transport. The main technical tool behind these results is a variational principle for evaluating the transport of candidate designs. The principle admits dual formulations for bounding transport from above and below. While the upper bound is closely related to the “background method,” the lower bound reveals a connection between the optimal design problems considered herein and other apparently related model problems from mathematical materials science. These connections serve to motivate designs. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {A targeted turbulent flow control strategy, based on selective heating of streamwise-aligned heat strips, is assessed for drag reduction using direct numerical simulations of variable viscosity and compressible turbulent channel flows. As increasing the temperature of a gas increases its viscosity, heating is generally an unfavorable drag mitigation approach. However, through a selective spatial arrangement of the heating array, the slight increase in viscosity and decrease in density can serve to modify the organization of the streamwise-aligned structures and the likelihood of the ejection and sweep events near the wall. This can, under specific conditions, lead to a very modest drag reduction. The optimal spatial arrangement is identified using a bidimensional empirical mode decomposition and targets the near-wall, large-scale turbulent motion. The drag coefficient, at constant mass flow rate, remains unchanged with heating despite up to an 11\% increase in the local viscosity above the heating strips. When accounting for the viscosity variation in the drag reduction calculation, an effective drag reduction of 6\% is observed.},

Explicit treatment of the nonlinear advection terms leaves the system coupled only through the thermal body-force term. Further explicit treatment of this body-force term decouples both the Navier-Stokes and the advection-diﬀusion equations. For the temporal discretisation, an implicit-explicit (IMEX) scheme is used. In order to split velocity and pressure ﬁelds in the momentum equations, a higher order stiﬄy stable splitting scheme is employed. To impose the ﬂowrate constraint, a Green function method is applied. Details of the algorithm are delineated. To capture the steady-state solution, an encapsulated selective frequency damping technique is conﬁgured for the current case.

Depending on the angle of inclination and the imposed temperature difference, the ﬂow exhibits a large variety of self-organized spatio-temporal convection patterns. Close to onset, these patterns have been explained in terms of linear stability analysis of primary and secondary ﬂow states. At a larger temperature difference, far beyond onset, experiments and simulations show complex, dynamically evolving patterns that are not described by stability analysis and remain to be explained. Here we employ a dynamical systems approach. We construct stable and unstable exact invariant states, including equilibria and periodic orbits of the fully nonlinear three-dimensional Oberbeck–Boussinesq equations. These invariant states underlie the observed convection patterns beyond their onset. We identify state space trajectories that, starting from the unstable laminar ﬂow, follow a sequence of dynamical connections between unstable invariant states until the dynamics approaches a stable attractor. Together, the network of dynamically connected invariant states mediates temporal transitions between coexisting invariant states and thereby supports the observed complex time-dependent dynamics in inclined layer convection.},

	abstract = {Convection in a layer inclined against gravity is a thermally driven non-equilibrium system, in which both buoyancy and shear forces drive spatio-temporally complex ﬂows. As a function of the strength of thermal driving and the angle of inclination, a multitude of convection patterns is observed in experiments and numerical simulations. Several observed patterns have been linked to exact invariant states of the fully nonlinear three-dimensional Oberbeck–Boussinesq equations. These exact equilibria, travelling waves and periodic orbits reside in state space and, depending on their stability properties, are transiently visited by the dynamics or act as attractors. To explain the dependence of observed convection patterns on control parameters, we study the parameter dependence of the state space structure. Speciﬁcally, we identify the bifurcations that modify the existence, stability and connectivity of invariant states. We numerically continue exact invariant states underlying spatially periodic convection patterns at Pr = 1.07 under changing control parameters for a temperature difference between the walls and inclination angle. The resulting state branches cover various inclinations from horizontal layer convection to vertical layer convection and beyond. The collection of all computed branches represents an extensive bifurcation network connecting 16 different invariant states across control parameter values. Individual bifurcation structures are discussed in detail and related to the observed complex dynamics of individual convection patterns. Together, the bifurcations and associated state branches indicate at what control parameter values which invariant states coexist. This provides a nonlinear framework to explain the multitude of complex ﬂow dynamics arising in inclined layer convection.},

              ) and show two distinct types of instability in the form of non-oscillatory disturbances. The ‘zigzag instability’ corresponds to a bending of the original rolls; in the ‘cross-roll instability’ rolls emerge at right angles to the original rolls. At Rayleigh numbers above 23,000 rolls are unstable for all wave-numbers and are replaced by a three-dimensional form of stationary convection for which the name ‘bimodal convection’ is proposed.},

	abstract = {Rayleigh–Bénard convection is one of the most well-studied models in fluid mechanics. Atmospheric convection, one of the most important components of the climate system, is by comparison complicated and poorly understood. A key attribute of atmospheric convection is the buoyancy source provided by the condensation of water vapour, but the presence of radiation, compressibility, liquid water and ice further complicate the system and our understanding of it. In this paper we present an idealized model of moist convection by taking the Boussinesq limit of the ideal-gas equations and adding a condensate that obeys a simplified Clausius–Clapeyron relation. The system allows moist convection to be explored at a fundamental level and reduces to the classical Rayleigh–Bénard model if the latent heat of condensation is taken to be zero. The model has an exact, Rayleigh-number-independent ‘drizzle’ solution in which the diffusion of water vapour from a saturated lower surface is balanced by condensation, with the temperature field (and so the saturation value of the moisture) determined self-consistently by the heat released in the condensation. This state is the moist analogue of the conductive solution in the classical problem. We numerically determine the linear stability properties of this solution as a function of Rayleigh number and a non-dimensional latent-heat parameter. We also present some two-dimensional, time-dependent, nonlinear solutions at various values of Rayleigh number and the non-dimensional condensational parameters. At sufficiently low Rayleigh number the system converges to the drizzle solution, and we find no evidence that two-dimensional self-sustained convection can occur when that solution is stable. The flow transitions from steady to turbulent as the Rayleigh number or the effects of condensation are increased, with plumes triggered by gravity waves emanating from other plumes. The interior dries as the level of turbulence increases, because the plumes entrain more dry air and because the saturated boundary layer at the top becomes thinner. The flow develops a broad relative humidity minimum in the domain interior, only weakly dependent on Rayleigh number when that is high.},

              , vol. 97, 2018, 053107) have observed a variety of convection patterns which are not described by linear stability analysis. We investigate the fully nonlinear dynamics of vertical convection using a dynamical-systems approach based on the Oberbeck–Boussinesq equations. We compute the invariant solutions of these equations and the bifurcations that are responsible for the creation and termination of various branches. We map out a sequence of local bifurcations from the laminar base state, including simultaneous bifurcations involving patterned steady states with different symmetries. This atypical phenomenon of multiple branches simultaneously bifurcating from a single parent branch is explained by the role of

              symmetry. In addition, two global bifurcations are identified: first, a homoclinic cycle from modulated transverse rolls and second, a heteroclinic cycle linking two symmetry-related diamond-roll patterns. These are confirmed by phase space projections as well as the functional form of the divergence of the period close to the bifurcation points. The heteroclinic orbit is shown to be robust and to result from a 1:2 mode interaction. The intricacy of this bifurcation diagram highlights the essential role played by dynamical systems theory and computation in hydrodynamic configurations.},

We explore the observed dynamics by constructing invariant solutions of the three-dimensional Oberbeck–Boussinesq equations, characterizing the stability of these equilibria and periodic orbits, and following the bifurcation structure of the solution branches under parametric continuation in Rayleigh number. We find that in a narrow vertically periodic domain of aspect ratio 10, the flow is dominated by the competition between three and four co-rotating rolls. We demonstrate that branches of three- and four-roll equilibria are connected and can be understood in terms of their discrete symmetries. Specifically, the
