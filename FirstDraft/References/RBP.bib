	abstract = {In studying the stability of a thermally stratified fluid in the presence of a viscous shear flow, we have a situation in which there is an important interaction between the mechanism of instability due to the stratification and the Tollmien-Schlichting mechanism due to the shear. A complete analysis has been carried out for the Bénard problem in the presence of a plane Poiseuille flow and it is shown that, although Squire's transformation can be used to reduce the three-dimensional problem to an equivalent two-dimensional one, a theorem of Squire's type does not follow unless the Richardson number exceeds a certain small negative value. This conclusion follows from the fact that, when the stratification is unstable and the Prandtl number is unity, the equivalent two-dimensional problem becomes identical mathematically to the stability problem for spiral flow between rotating cylinders and, from the known results for the spiral flow problem, Squire's transformation can then be used to obtain the complete three-dimensional stability boundary. For the case of stable stratification, however, Squire's theorem is valid and the instability is of the usual Tollmien—Schlichting type. Additional calculations have been made for this case which show that the flow is completely stabilized when the Richardson number exceeds a certain positive value.},

At first, the linear stability analysis by Clever and Busse [JFM, 1991] in the case of PRB flows between two infinite plates is extended to the case of confined channels with a 10 transversal aspect ratio. In the second part, using 3D non linear direct numerical simulations, the space and time development of the chaotic wavy rolls obtained by maintaining a permanent random excitation at channel inlet is analyzed. As the perturbation is designed to cover all the modes, it is possible to detect the modes that are naturally amplified by the flow and those that are damped. It is shown that the wavy roll characteristics obtained in this way vary a lot with Ra increasing and stabilize for Ra{\textgreater}3Ra*. Comparisons with the experiments by Pabiou et al. [JFM, 2005] are proposed.},

	abstract = {It is demonstrated that a signiﬁcant drag reduction for pressure-driven ﬂows can be realized by applying spatially distributed heating. The heating creates separation bubbles that separate the stream from the bounding walls and, at the same time, alter the distribution of the Reynolds stress, thereby providing a propulsive force. The strength of this effect is of practical interest for heating with wavenumbers α = O(1) and for ﬂows with small Reynolds numbers and, thus, it is of potential interest for applications in micro-channels. Explicit results given for a very simple sinusoidal heating demonstrate that the drag-reducing effect increases proportionally to the second power of the heating intensity. This increase saturates if the heating becomes too intense. Drag reduction decreases as α4 when the heating wavenumber becomes too small, and as α−7 when the heating wavenumber becomes too large; this decrease is due to the reduction in the magnitude of the Reynolds stress. The drag reduction can reach up to 87 \% for the heating intensities of interest and heating patterns corresponding to the most effective heating wavenumber.},

	abstract = {An investigation of the effect of a destabilizing cross-stream temperature gradient on the transient growth phenomenon of plane Poiseuille flow and plane Couette flow is presented. Only the streamwise-uniform and nearly streamwise-uniform disturbances are highly influenced by the Rayleigh number Ra and Prandtl number Pr. The maximum optimal transient growth Gmax of streamwise-uniform disturbances increases slowly with increasing Ra and decreasing Pr. For all Ra and Pr, at moderately large Reynolds numbers Re, the supremum of Gmax is always attained for streamwise-uniform perturbations (or nearly streamwise-uniform perturbations, in the case of plane Couette flow) which produce large streamwise streaks and Rayleigh-Bénard convection rolls (RB). The optimal growth curves retain the same large-Reynolds-number scaling as in pure shear flow. A 3D vector model of the governing equations demonstrates that the short-time behavior is governed by the classical lift-up mechanism and that the influence of Ra on this mechanism is secondary and negligible. The optimal input for the largest long-time response is given by the adjoint of the dominant eigenmode with respect to the energy scalar product: the RB eigenmode without its streamwise velocity component. These short-time and long-time responses depict, to leading order, the optimal transient growth G(t). At moderately large Ra (or small Pr at a fixed Ra), the dominant adjoint mode is a good approximation to the optimal initial condition for all time. Over a general class of norms that can be considered as growth functions, the results remain qualitatively similar, for example, the dominant adjoint eigenmode still approximates the maximum optimal response.},

For the Reynolds numbers lower than 80 with a large computational domain of 51.2 × 2 × 22.5, the turbulent puff was observed and its signiﬁcant inﬂuences on the momentum and heat transports were found. The spatial structure of the equilibrium puff, or the localized turbulence, was examined with taking account of two different thermal boundary conditions: the uniform heat-ﬂux heating and the constant temperature difference between the walls. It was revealed that there existed a localized strong turbulent region in the form of an oblique band, along which a spanwise secondary ﬂow was induced. In consequence, at the present lowest Reynolds number as low as 60, the ﬂow remained turbulent and the larger Nusselt numbers than those without puff was obtained by the presence of puff.},

The most intense convection is observed when the upper and lower hot spots are located above each other. It has been demonstrated that the heating results in a signiﬁcant reduction of the pressure gradient required to drive the ﬂow when compared to a similar ﬂow in an isothermal channel. The drag reduction is associated with the formation of separation bubbles which insulate the stream from direct contact with the bounding walls. The ﬂuid inside of the bubbles rotates due to horizontal density gradients, which further reduces the required pressure gradient. The magnitude of the drag reduction depends on the phase shift between the heating patterns and can increase by up to threefold when compared to the drag reduction which can be achieved by heating only one wall.

The combined effect of forced and free convection produces a peculiar pattern of quasi-streamwise rollers occupying the full channel thickness, with aspect ratio considerably higher than unity; it has been observed that they have an important redistributing effect on temperature and momentum, providing for a substantial fraction of the heat and momentum flux at bulk Richardson numbers larger than

We find that the Monin–Obukhov theory nevertheless yields a useful representation of the main flow features. In particular, the widely used Businger–Dyer flux-profile relationships are found to provide a convenient way of approximately accounting for the bulk effects of friction and buoyancy, although the individual profiles may have wide scatter from the alleged trends. Significant deviations are found in direct numerical simulations with respect to the commonly used parametrization of the momentum flux in the light-wind regime, which may have important practical impact in wall models of atmospheric dynamics. Finally, for modelling purposes, we devise a set of empirical predictive formulae for the heat flux and friction coefficients, which are within approximately

The present numerical investigation of the inclined layer convection system is based on the standard Oberbeck-Boussinesq equations. The patterns are shown to originate from a complicated competition of buoyancy-driven and shear-flow driven pattern forming mechanisms. The former are expressed as {\textbackslash}rm\{longitudinal\} convection rolls with their axes oriented parallel to the incline, the latter as perpendicular {\textbackslash}rm\{transverse\} rolls. Along with conventional methods to study roll patterns and their stability, we employ direct numerical simulations in large spatial domains, comparable with the experimental ones. As a result, we determine the phase diagram of the characteristic complex 3D convection patterns above onset of convection in the \${\textbackslash}gamma-R\$ plane, and find that it compares very well with the experiments. In particular we demonstrate that interactions of specific Fourier modes, characterized by a resonant interaction of their wavevectors in the layer plane, are key to understanding the pattern morphologies.},

The system response strongly depends on the characterization of both patterns and on their relative position, leading to a pattern interaction problem. Mismatch and misplacement of both patterns may result in a significant increase in pressure losses or may have no effect on such losses. The reduction in pressure loss is associated with the formation of convection rolls on the bounding surfaces due to spatially distributed buoyancy along the streamwise direction. The pressuregradient-reducing effect is active only in small Reynolds number flows. Explicit results are given for fluids with the Prandtl number Pr = 0.71, representing air.},

              We study the convective patterns that arise in a nearly semicylindrical cavity fed in with hot fluid at the upper boundary, bounded by a cold, porous semicircular boundary at the bottom, and infinitely extended in the third direction. While this configuration is relevant to continuous casting processes that are significantly more complex, we focus on the flow patterns associated with the particular form of mixed convection that arises in it. Linear stability analysis (LSA) and direct numerical simulations (DNS) are conducted, using the spectral-element method to identify observable states. The nature of the bifurcations is determined through Stuart–Landau analysis for completeness. The base flow consists of two counter-rotating rolls driven by the baroclinic imbalance due to the curved isothermal boundary. These are, however, suppressed by the through-flow, which is found to have a stabilising influence as soon as the Reynolds number

Comparison of heat transfer coefficients for fully developed cases and those for confined cases indicates that there is no appreciable difference between them.

	abstract = {The present paper concerns Poiseuille-Rayleigh-Bénard mixed convection flows in horizontal rectangular air-filled channels of large spanwise aspect ratio (W/H ≥ 10) and it focuses on the primary and secondary thermoconvective instabilities made of steady longitudinal and unsteady wavy rolls for 100 ≤ Re ≤ 200, 3000 \&lt; Ra \&lt; 15 000, Pr = 0.7, and W/H = 10. Time linear stability analysis of longitudinal rolls and 3D nonlinear numerical simulations using a specially tailored finite difference code is performed for this purpose. A bibliographical review, linear stability analysis and 3D numerical simulations allow establishing the full stability diagram for Re ≤ 300 and Ra ≤ 20 000. The linear stability analysis indicates that the critical Rayleigh number Ra≈*(Re) of the neutral curve between longitudinal and wavy rolls for W/H = 10 is increased at least by a factor of 1.5 in comparison with infinite W/H. The numerical study shows that the usual definitions of growth lengths for longitudinal rolls are inappropriate and it explains the discrepancies observed on wall Nusselt numbers in the literature between experimental and numerical results for the fully developed longitudinal rolls: Nusselt number decreasing at Ra \&gt; 8000 is due to spanwise oscillations of thermoconvective rolls that favor a bulk temperature homogenization. Because they are a convective instability, wavy rolls and their space and time development are studied numerically by maintaining at channel inlet, a permanent random excitation: it is designed to cover all the modes and allows detecting the wavy roll modes that are naturally amplified by the flow and those that are damped. Wavy roll patterns are characterized with respect to its three control parameters: Re, the relative distance ɛ to the critical Rayleigh number Ra≈*, and the excitation magnitude Aexc. The growth length of the wavy rolls is shown to correlate with ɛ−0.72 and Log(Aexc). The frequency, wave number, and phase velocity of the most amplified mode, the wall averaged Nusselt number and the spanwise displacements of the wavy rolls are independent of Aexc in the fully developed zone, but depend a lot on ɛ for ɛ \&lt; 2 and nearly stabilize for ɛ \&gt; 2 (i.e., Ra \&gt; 3Ra≈*). Correlation laws as a function of Re, ɛ, and Aexc are proposed for most of the exploited quantities. Numerical simulations performed are in a good agreement with experimental results on the wavy rolls obtained by Pabiou et al. [“Wavy secondary instability of longitudinal rolls in Rayleigh-Bénard-Poiseuille flows,” J. Fluid Mech. 542, 175 (2005)10.1017/S0022112005006154]. Finally, wavy roll characteristics are shown to be potentially interesting to better homogenize the vapor depositions in the horizontal rectangular chemical vapor deposition reactors used to make thin coatings on heated substrates from gaseous components.},
