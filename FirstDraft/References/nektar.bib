	abstract = {Nektar++ is an open-source software framework designed to support the development of highperformance scalable solvers for partial differential equations using the spectral/hp element method. High-order methods are gaining prominence in several engineering and biomedical applications due to their improved accuracy over low-order techniques at reduced computational cost for a given number of degrees of freedom. However, their proliferation is often limited by their complexity, which makes these methods challenging to implement and use. Nektar++ is an initiative to overcome this limitation by encapsulating the mathematical complexities of the underlying method within an efficient C++ framework, making the techniques more accessible to the broader scientific and industrial communities. The software supports a variety of discretisation techniques and implementation strategies, supporting methods research as well as application-focused computation, and the multi-layered structure of the framework allows the user to embrace as much or as little of the complexity as they need. The libraries capture the mathematical constructs of spectral/hp element methods, while the associated collection of pre-written PDE solvers provides out-of-the-box application-level functionality and a template for users who wish to develop solutions for addressing questions in their own scientific domains.},

	abstract = {We report on a high-fidelity, spectral/hp element algorithm developed for the direct numerical simulation of thermal convection problems. We consider the incompressible Navier–Stokes (NS) and advection–diffusion equations coupled through a thermal body-forcing term. The flow is driven by a prescribed flowrate forcing with explicit treatment of the nonlinear advection terms. The explicit treatment of the body-force term also decouples both the NS and the advection–diffusion equations. The problem is then temporally discretized using an implicit–explicit scheme in conjunction with a velocity-correction splitting scheme to decouple the velocity and pressure fields in the momentum equation. Although not unique, this type of discretization has not been widely applied to thermal convection problems and we therefore provide a comprehensive overview of the algorithm and implementation which is available through the open-source package Nektar++. After verifying the algorithm on a number of illustrative problems we then apply the code to investigate flow in a channel with uniform or streamwise sinusoidal lower wall, in addition to a patterned sinusoidal heating. We verify the solver against previously published two-dimensional results. Finally, for the first time we consider a three-dimensional problem with a streamwise sinusoidal lower wall and sinusoidal heating which, for the chosen parameter, leads to the unusual dynamics of an initially unsteady two-dimensional instability leading to a steady three-dimensional nonlinear saturated state.},
