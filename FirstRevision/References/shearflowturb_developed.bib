	abstract = {Extensive visual and quantitative studies of turbulent boundary layers are described. Visual studies reveal the presence of surprisingly well-organized spatially and temporally dependent motions within the so-called ‘laminar sublayer’. These motions lead to the formation of low-speed streaks in the region very near the wall. The streaks interact with the outer portions of the flow through a process of gradual ‘lift-up’, then sudden oscillation, bursting, and ejection. It is felt that these processes play a dominant role in the production of new turbulence and the transport of turbulence within the boundary layer on smooth walls.
            Quantitative data are presented providing an association of the observed structure features with the accepted ‘regions’ of the boundary layer in non-dimensional co-ordinates; these data include zero, negative and positive pressure gradients on smooth walls. Instantaneous spanwise velocity profiles for the inner layers are given, and dimensionless correlations for mean streak-spacing and break-up frequency are presented.
            Tentative mechanisms for formation and break-up of the low-speed streaks are proposed, and other evidence regarding the implications and importance of the streak structure in turbulent boundary layers is reviewed.},

Using correspondence between theory and experiment in laminar flow as a means for acceptance of published data, turbulent flow data for smooth rectangular ducts were compared with smooth circular tube data. Data for ducts having aspect ratios between unity and 39:1 were obtained in the literature and, in conjunction with new experimental data, were examined for deviations from the smooth circular tube line (smooth Moody). It was found that at constant Reynolds number based on hydraulic diameter the friction factor increases monotonically with increasing aspect ratio. It was thus concluded that the hydraulic diameter is not the proper length dimension to use in the Reynolds number to insure similarity between the circular and rectangular ducts. Instead, it was determined that if a modified Reynolds number Re* was obtained so that geometric similarity was provided in laminar flow by the relation f = 64/Re* for all geometries, that this Reynolds number also provided good similarity in fully developed turbulent flow within a ∼ 5 percent scatter band about the smooth tube line. By using this “laminar equivalent” Reynolds number, Re*, it is demonstrated that circular tube methods may be readily applied to rectangular ducts eliminating large errors in estimation of friction factor.},

For a narrow range of widths below that threshold, the flow near only one wall remains turbulent, but its statistics are still in fairly good agreement with experimental data when scaled with the local wall stress. For narrower boxes only laminar solutions are found. In all cases, the elementary box contains a single low-velocity streak, consisting of a longitudinal strip on which a thin layer of spanwise vorticity is lifted away from the wall. A fundamental period of intermittency for the regeneration of turbulence is identified, and that process is observed to consist of the wrapping of the wall-layer vorticity around a single inclined longitudinal vortex.},

This consistency is verified by the relationship between streamwise wavenumber spectra and spanwise wavenumber spectra. The high-wavenumber behaviour of the pressure spectrum is also consistent with local isotropy and compares favourably with the calculation of Batchelor (1951), which assumes isotropy and joint normality of the velocity field at two points in space. The latter assumption is validated by the shape but not the magnitude of the quadruple correlation of the streamwise velocity fluctuation at small separations. There is only partial support for local spectral isotropy away from the centreline as the magnitude of the mean strain rate increases.},

Visualization of regions in the flow with stable focus/stretching topologies revealed arrays of discrete downstream-leaning flow structures which originated near the wall and penetrated into the outer region of the flow.

              assumptions other than the finite prediction horizon,
              T

              Flow relaminarization, accompanied by a drag reduction of over 50\%, is obtained 
in some of the control cases with the predictive control approach in direct numerical 
simulations of subcritical turbulent channel flows. Such performance far exceeds what 
has been obtained to date in similar flows (using this type of actuation) via adaptive 
strategies such as neural networks, intuition-based strategies such as opposition 
control, and the so-called ‘suboptimal’ strategies, which involve optimizations over a 
vanishingly small prediction horizon

            The predictive control algorithm requires full flow field information and is computationally 
expensive, involving iterative direct numerical simulations. It is, therefore, 
impossible to implement this algorithm directly in a practical setting. However, these 
calculations allow us to quantify the best possible system performance given a certain 
class of flow actuation and to qualify how optimized controls correlate with the 
near-wall coherent structures believed to dominate the process of turbulence production 
in wall-bounded flows. Further, various approaches have been proposed to 
distil practical feedback schemes from the predictive control approach without the 
suboptimal approximation, which is shown in the present work to restrict severely 
the effectiveness of the resulting control algorithm. The present work thus represents 
a further step towards the determination of optimally effective yet implementable 
control strategies for the mitigation or enhancement of the consequential effects of 
turbulence.},

            Streamwise rolls and accompanying streamwise streaks are ubiquitous in wall-bounded shear flows, both in natural settings, such as the atmospheric boundary layer, as well as in controlled settings, such as laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. The streamwise roll and streak structure has been associated with both transition from the laminar to the turbulent state and with maintenance of the turbulent state. This close association of the streamwise roll and streak structure with the transition to and maintenance of turbulence in wall-bounded shear flow has engendered intense theoretical interest in the dynamics of this structure. In this work, stochastic structural stability theory (SSST) is applied to the problem of understanding the dynamics of the streamwise roll and streak structure. The method of analysis used in SSST comprises a stochastic turbulence model (STM) for the dynamics of perturbations from the streamwise-averaged flow coupled to the associated streamwise-averaged flow dynamics. The result is an autonomous, deterministic, nonlinear dynamical system for evolving a second-order statistical mean approximation of the turbulent state. SSST analysis reveals a robust interaction between streamwise roll and streak structures and turbulent perturbations in which the perturbations are systematically organized through their interaction with the streak to produce Reynolds stresses that coherently force the associated streamwise roll structure. If a critical value of perturbation turbulence intensity is exceeded, this feedback results in modal instability of the combined streamwise roll/streak and associated turbulence complex in the SSST system. In this instability, the perturbations producing the destabilizing Reynolds stresses are predicted by the STM to take the form of oblique structures, which is consistent with observations. In the SSST system this instability exists together with the transient growth process. These processes cooperate in determining the structure of growing streamwise roll and streak. For this reason, comparison of SSST predictions with experiments requires accounting for both the amplitude and structure of initial perturbations as well as the influence of the SSST instability. Over a range of supercritical turbulence intensities in Couette flow, this instability equilibrates to form finite amplitude time-independent streamwise roll and streak structures. At sufficiently high levels of forcing of the perturbation field, equilibration of the streamwise roll and streak structure does not occur and the flow transitions to a time-dependent state. This time-dependent state is self-sustaining in the sense that it persists when the forcing is removed. Moreover, this self-sustaining state rapidly evolves toward a minimal representation of wall-bounded shear flow turbulence in which the dynamics is limited to interaction of the streamwise-averaged flow with a perturbation structure at one streamwise wavenumber. In this minimal realization of the self-sustaining process, the time-dependent streamwise roll and streak structure is maintained by perturbation Reynolds stresses, just as is the case of the time-independent streamwise roll and streak equilibria. However, the perturbation field is maintained not by exogenously forced turbulence, but rather by an endogenous and essentially non-modal parametric growth process that is inherent to time-dependent dynamical systems.},

The artiﬁcial removal of the wide outer turbulence is conducted with spanwise minimal computational domains and an explicit ﬁlter that effectively removes spanwise uniform eddies. The mean velocity proﬁle of the remaining motions shows very good agreement with that of the full simulation below y+ ' 40, and the near-wall peaks of the streamwise velocity ﬂuctuation scale very well in the inner units and remain almost constant at all the Reynolds numbers considered. The self-sustaining motions narrower than λz+ ' 100 generate smaller turbulent skin friction than full turbulent motions, and their contribution to turbulent skin friction gradually decays with the Reynolds number. This ﬁnding suggests that the role of the removed outer structures becomes increasingly important with the Reynolds number; thus one should aim to control the large scales for turbulent drag reduction at high Reynolds numbers. In the near-wall region, the streamwise and spanwise velocity ﬂuctuations of the motions of λz+ 6 100 reveal signiﬁcant lack of energy at long streamwise lengths compared to those of the full simulation. In contrast, the losses of the wall-normal velocity and the Reynolds stress are not as large as those of these two variables. This implies that the streamwise and spanwise velocities of the removed motions penetrate deep into the near-wall region, while the wall-normal velocity and the Reynolds stress do not.},

	abstract = {Roughness predominantly alters the near-wall region of turbulent flow while the outer layer remains similar with respect to the wall shear stress. This makes it a prime candidate for the minimal-span channel, which only captures the near-wall flow by restricting the spanwise channel width to be of the order of a few hundred viscous units. Recently, Chung
              et al.
              (
              J. Fluid Mech.
              , vol. 773, 2015, pp. 418–431) showed that a minimal-span channel can accurately characterise the hydraulic behaviour of roughness. Following this, we aim to investigate the fundamental dynamics of the minimal-span channel framework with an eye towards further improving performance. The streamwise domain length of the channel is investigated with the minimum length found to be three times the spanwise width or 1000 viscous units, whichever is longer. The outer layer of the minimal channel is inherently unphysical and as such alterations to it can be performed so long as the near-wall flow, which is the same as in a full-span channel, remains unchanged. Firstly, a half-height (open) channel with slip wall is shown to reproduce the near-wall behaviour seen in a standard channel, but with half the number of grid points. Next, a forcing model is introduced into the outer layer of a half-height channel. This reduces the high streamwise velocity associated with the minimal channel and allows for a larger computational time step. Finally, an investigation is conducted to see if varying the roughness Reynolds number with time is a feasible method for obtaining the full hydraulic behaviour of a rough surface. Currently, multiple steady simulations at fixed roughness Reynolds numbers are needed to obtain this behaviour. The results indicate that the non-dimensional pressure gradient parameter must be kept below 0.03–0.07 to ensure that pressure gradient effects do not lead to an inaccurate roughness function. An empirical costing argument is developed to determine the cost in terms of CPU hours of minimal-span channel simulations
              a priori
              . This argument involves counting the number of eddy lifespans in the channel, which is then related to the statistical uncertainty of the streamwise velocity. For a given statistical uncertainty in the roughness function, this can then be used to determine the simulation run time. Following this, a finite-volume code with a body-fitted grid is used to determine the roughness function for square-based pyramids using the above insights. Comparisons to experimental studies for the same roughness geometry are made and good agreement is observed.},

	abstract = {The quest for reductions in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions in transport has been a powerful driving force for scientiﬁc research into methods that might underpin drag-reducing technologies for a variety of vehicular transport on roads, by rail, in the air, and on or in the water. In civil aviation, skin-friction drag accounts for around 50\% of the total drag in cruise conditions, thus being a preferential target for research. With laminar conditions excluded, skin friction is intimately linked to the turbulence physics in the ﬂuid layer closest to the skin. Hence, research into drag reduction has focused on methods to depress the turbulence activity near the surface. The most eﬀective method of doing so is to exercise active control on the near-wall layer by subjecting the drag-producing ﬂow in this layer to an unsteady and/or spatially varying cross-ﬂow component, either by the action of transverse wall oscillations, by embedding rotating discs into the surface or by plasma-producing electrodes that accelerate the near-wall ﬂuid in the transverse direction. In ideal conditions, drag-reduction margins of order of 50\% can thereby be achieved. The present article provides a near-exhaustive review of research into the response of turbulent near-wall layers to the imposition of unsteady and wavy transverse motion. The review encompasses experiments, simulation, analysis and modelling, mainly in channel ﬂows and boundary layers. It covers issues such as the drag-reduction margin in a variety of actuation scenarios and for a wide range of actuation parameters, the underlying physical phenomena that contribute to the interpretation of the origin of the drag reduction, the dependence of the drag reduction on the Reynolds number, passive control methods that are inspired by active control, and a forward look towards possible future research and practical realizations. The authors hope that this review, by far the most extensive of its kind for this subject, will be judged as a useful foundation for future research targeting friction-drag reduction.},

	abstract = {The present study experimentally determines the transitional Reynolds number range for plane channel flow and characterizes its transitional state. The pressure along the channel is measured to determine the skin friction coefficient as function of Reynolds number from the laminar state, through the transitional region into the fully turbulent state. The flow structure was studied through flow visualisation which shows that as the Reynolds number increases from the laminar state the transitional region starts showing randomly occurring turbulent spots. With increasing Reynolds number the spots shift into oblique patches and bands of small scale turbulence that form across the channel width, together with large-scale streaky structures found in areas between the turbulent regions. An image analysing technique was used to determine the intermittency factor, i.e. the turbulence fraction in the flow, as function of Reynolds number. It is found that the skin friction coefficient reaches its turbulent value before the flow is fully turbulent (the intermittency factor is still below one). This suggests that the observed streaky structures in non-turbulent regions contribute to the enhancement of the wall-normal transfer of momentum. Also above the Reynolds numbers where the turbulent skin friction coefficient has been established large-scale features consisting of irregular streaky structures are found. They have an oblique shape similar to the non-turbulent and turbulent patches in the transitional flow indicating that the transition process is not fully complete even above the Reynolds number where the skin friction reaches its turbulent level.},

However, its spectral counterpart, a well-developed k−1 spectrum (k is the spatial wavenumber in a wall-parallel direction), has not been convincingly observed from the same data. In the present study, we revisit the spectrum-based attached eddy model of Perry and co-workers, who proposed the emergence of a k−1 spectrum in the inviscid limit, for small but ﬁnite z/δ and for ﬁnite Reynolds numbers (z is the wall-normal coordinate, and δ is the outer length scale). In the upper logarithmic layer (or inertial sublayer), a reexamination reveals that the intensity of the spectrum must vary with the wall-normal location at order of z/δ, consistent with the early observation argued with ‘incomplete similarity’. The streamwise turbulence intensity is subsequently calculated, demonstrating that the existence of a well-developed k−1 spectrum is not a necessary condition for the approximate logarithmic wall-normal dependence of turbulence intensity – a more general condition is the existence of a premultiplied power-spectral intensity of O(1) for O(1/δ) {\textless} k {\textless} O(1/z). Furthermore, it is shown that the Townsend–Perry constant must be weakly dependent on the Reynolds number. Finally, the analysis is semi-empirically extended to the lower logarithmic layer (or mesolayer), and a near-wall correction for the turbulence intensity is subsequently proposed. All the predictions of the proposed model and the related analyses/assumptions are validated with high-ﬁdelity experimental data (Samie et al., J. Fluid Mech., vol. 851, 2018, pp. 391–415).},

Starting from a fully developed turbulent flow, the dimensions of the computational domain are reduced to near the minimum values which will sustain turbulence. A remarkably well-defined, quasi-cyclic and spatially organized process of regeneration of near-wall structures is observed. This process is composed of three distinct phases: formation of streaks by streamwise vortices, breakdown of the streaks, and regeneration of the streamwise vortices. Each phase sets the stage for the next, and these processes are analysed in detail. The most novel results concern vortex regeneration, which is found to be a direct result of the breakdown of streaks that were originally formed by the vortices, and particular emphasis is placed on this process. The spanwise width of the computational domain corresponds closely to the typically observed spanwise spacing of near-wall streaks. When the width of the domain is further reduced, turbulence is no longer sustained. It is suggested that the observed spacing arises because the time scales of streak formation, breakdown and vortex regeneration become mismatched when the streak spacing is too small, and the regeneration cycle at that scale is broken.},

	abstract = {During the course of study, by the authors, of the flow of fluids in the small clearances which exist between the moving and fixed parts of certain machines, an accurate knowledge was desired of the range over which the equations of viscous flow could be applied. An exhaustive search revealed an absence of any record of experimental work which could be of direct assistance. An investigation was accordingly undertaken with the object of obtaining the desired information, and as the preliminary results were of an interesting and unexpected nature, the experiments were extended to cover the whole range of velocities and dimensions permitted by the apparatus. They have shown briefly that the lower critical velocity (as ordinarily understood) for flow between flat plates occurs at a value of the Reynolds number about one-half that found for pipes of circular cross section, if the linear dimension in that number is the distance between the plates and the diameter respectively. For velocities well below this limit there is evidence, however, of a distinct deviation from true viscous flow if initial disturbing factors are present, and the influence of such disturbing factors does not disappear entirely until a second well-defined limit is reached, which has a value of about one-tenth of the lower critical number. It would appear that below this limit eddies do not exist at any point in the pipe, and the flow is truly viscous. The suggestion is accordingly made that there may be three distinct types of flow: (
              a
              ) one in which eddies cannot exist, corresponding to truly viscous flow; (
              b
              ) one in which eddies may exist, due to an initial disturbance, but cannot be sustained in the pipe, the initial eddies therefore ultimately disappearing; and (
              c
              ) one in which eddies once generated will be maintained without decrement throughout the pipe, corresponding to truly turbulent flow. The use of a channel of rectangular cross section for a study of the fundamental laws of the flow of fluids possesses advantages, in point of simplicity, which were recognised at once by Reynolds in his classical research into the cause of instability of flow. In the form in which this channel is used by the present writers, an additional and important advantage is obtained over the circular pipe by the fact that the controlling dimension may be varied over a wide range whilst retaining the same surfaces as boundaries. It is, in essentials, an adjustable pipe. The upper plate A (fig. 1) and the lower plate B are brass castings suitably drilled to provide inlet and outlet passages and pressure measuring points. The surfaces forming the pipe are hand scraped to a surface plate, and are separated at the ends by brass foil shims of suitable thickness, thus providing a passage between the inlet and outlet ports. The sides of this passage are closed by the plates C and D, very thin rubber insertion providing a watertight joint. All parts are sufficiently robust to reduce distortion under pressure to an amount found to be negligible.},

              positive,
              v
              positive, corresponding to high-speed fluid reflected outwards from the wall, were found to account for the ‘excess’ stress produced by the first two categories, which give contributions of opposite sign.
            
            
              The autocorrelations of the classified portions of
              uv
              were obtained to determine the relative time scales of these four types of motion. The positive stress producing motions (
              u
              {\textless} 0,
              v
              {\textgreater} 0 and
              u
              {\textgreater} 0,
              v
              {\textless} 0) were found to have significantly larger time scales than the negative stress producing motions (
              u
              {\textless} 0,
              v
              {\textless} 0 and
              u
              {\textgreater} 0,
              v
              {\textgreater} 0). It was further surmised that turbulent energy dissipation is associated with the Reynolds stress producing motions, since these result in localized shear regions in which the dissipation is several orders of magnitude greater than the average dissipation at the wall.},

	abstract = {Experimental studies of the flow field near the wall in a turbulent boundary layer using hot-wire probes are reported. Measurements of the product
              uv
              are studied using the technique of conditional sampling with a large digital computer to single out special events (bursting) when large contributions to turbulent energy and Reynolds stress occur. The criterion used to determine when the product
              uv
              is sampled is that the streamwise velocity at the edge of the sublayer should have attained a certain value. With this simple criterion we find that 60\% of the contribution to
              \${\textbackslash}overline\{uv\}\$
              is produced when the sublayer velocity is lower than the mean. This result is true at both low,
              R
              θ
              = 4230, and high,
              R
              θ
              = 38 000, Reynolds numbers. With a more strict sampling criterion, that the filtered sublayer velocity at two side-by-side points should be simultaneously low and decreasing, individual contributions to
              \${\textbackslash}overline\{uv\}\$
              as large as 62
              \${\textbackslash}overline\{uv\}\$
              have been identified. Additional measurements using correlations between truncated
              u
              and
              v
              signals reveal that the largest contributions to the Reynolds stress and turbulent energy occur when
              u
              {\textless} 0,
              v
              {\textgreater} 0 during an intense bursting process and the remainder of the contributions occur during a less intense recovery process. Thus, contributions to the turbulent energy production and Reynolds stress at a point near the wall are of relatively large magnitude, short duration and occur intermittently. A rough measure of the intermittency factor for
              uv
              at a point near the wall is 0·55 since 99\% of the contribution to
              \${\textbackslash}overline\{uv\}\$
              is made during only 55\% of the total time.},

            The uncertainties in the bubble data are large, but they have the distinct advantage of providing velocity profiles as a function of time and the time sequences of events. These data show that the velocity profiles during bursting periods assume a shape which is qualitatively distinct from the well-known mean profiles. The observations are also used as the basis for a discussion of possible appropriate mathematical models for turbulence production.},
