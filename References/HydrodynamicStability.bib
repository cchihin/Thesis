	abstract = {In recent work it has been shown that there can be substantial transient growth in the energy of small perturbations to plane Poiseuille and Couette flows if the Reynolds number is below the critical value predicted by linear stability analysis. This growth, which may be as large as
              O
              (1000), occurs in the absence of nonlinear effects and can be explained by the non-normality of the governing linear operator - that is, the non-orthogonality of the associated eigenfunctions. In this paper we study various aspects of this energy growth for two- and three-dimensional Poiseuille and Couette flows using energy methods, linear stability analysis, and a direct numerical procedure for computing the transient growth. We examine conditions for no energy growth, the dependence of the growth on the streamwise and spanwise wavenumbers, the time dependence of the growth, and the effects of degenerate eigenvalues. We show that the maximum transient growth behaves like
              O
              (
              R
              2
              ), where
              R
              is the Reynolds number. We derive conditions for no energy growth by applying the Hille–Yosida theorem to the governing linear operator and show that these conditions yield the same results as those derived by energy methods, which can be applied to perturbations of arbitrary amplitude. These results emphasize the fact that subcritical transition can occur for Poiseuille and Couette flows because the governing linear operator is non-normal.},

Though they have slightly larger growths than two-dimensional cases, they are broadly similar in character. When the inflow of the full nonlinear system is perturbed with white noise, narrowband random velocity perturbations are observed in the downstream channel at locations corresponding to maximum linear transient growth. The centre frequency of this response matches that computed from the streamwise wavelength and mean advection speed of the predicted optimal disturbance. Linkage between the response of the driven flow and the optimal disturbance is further demonstrated by a partition of response energy into velocity components.},

              element discretization using a hybrid mesh. Steady basic states are investigated by solution of the partial-derivative eigenvalue problem, while Floquet theory is used to analyse time-periodic flow set-up past the first bifurcation. The leading mode is associated with the wake and long-wavelength perturbations, while a second short-wavelength mode can be associated with the separation bubble at the trailing edge. The leading eigenvalues and Floquet multipliers of the LPT flow have been obtained in a range of spanwise wavenumbers. For the most general configuration all secondary modes were observed to be stable in the Reynolds number regime considered. When a single LPT blade with top to bottom periodicity is considered as a base flow, the imposed periodicity forces the wakes of adjacent blades to be synchronized. This enforced synchronization can produce a linear instability due to long-wavelength disturbances. However, relaxing the periodic restrictions is shown to remove this instability. A pseudo-spectrum analysis shows that the eigenvalues can become unstable due to the non-orthogonal properties of the eigenmodes. Three-dimensional direct numerical simulations confirm all perturbations identified herein.

In the three decades since it ﬁrst appeared in the literature, global instability analysis, based on the solution of the multidimensional eigenvalue and/or initial value problem, is continuously broadening both in scope and in depth. To date it has dealt successfully with a wide range of applications arising in aerospace engineering, physiological ﬂows, food processing, and nuclear-reactor safety. In recent years, nonmodal analysis has complemented the more traditional modal approach and increased knowledge of ﬂow instability physics. Recent highlights delivered by the application of either modal or nonmodal global analysis are brieﬂy discussed. A conscious effort is made to demystify both the tools currently utilized and the jargon employed to describe them, demonstrating the simplicity of the analysis. Hopefully this will provide new impulses for the creation of next-generation algorithms capable of coping with the main open research areas in which step-change progress can be expected by the application of the theory: instability analysis of fully inhomogeneous, 3D ﬂows and control thereof.},

The technique can be used to identify the most eﬃcient way to disturb a system such that it transits from one stable state to another. The key idea is introduced within the framework of a ﬁnite-dimensional set of ordinary diﬀerential equations (ODEs) and then illustrated for a very simple system of 2 ODEs which possesses bistability. Then the transition to turbulence problem in ﬂuid mechanics is used to show how the technique can be formulated for a spatially-extended system described by a partial diﬀerential equation (the well-known Navier-Stokes equation). Within that context, the optimisation technique bridges the gap between (linear) optimal perturbation theory and the (nonlinear) dynamical systems approach to ﬂuid ﬂows. The fact that the technique has now been recently shown to work in this very high dimensional setting augurs well for its utility in other physical systems.},

When coupled with a search over the disturbance amplitude, this can reveal the disturbance of least amplitude—called the minimal seed—for transition to another state such as turbulence. The approach bridges the theoretical gap between (linear) nonmodal theory and the (nonlinear) dynamical systems approach to ﬂuid ﬂows by allowing one to explore phase space at a ﬁnite distance from the reference ﬂow state.

	abstract = {The turbulence problem is still unsolved, through a number of valuable papers have been published on it comparatively recently. But, since Hopf and von Mises proved that uniform shearing motion between two parallel planes was stable for infinitesimal disturbances but unstable for disturbances of a finite size has become more and more widely held. Von mises suggested that the reoughness of the walls might be the determining factor, but the experiments of Schiller have shown that the degree of roughness of the walls is of negligible influence on the critical value of Reynold's number. He concluded that the breakdown of laminar flow depended primarily on the size of the initial disturbance, in agreement eith Osborne Reynold's view. Important papers have been published by Noether and Tollmien, whose conclusions are in contradiction to one another. On the one hand, Noether, by a formal investigation of the asymptotic solutions of the equation governing the two-dimensional disturbances of flow between parallel walls, claims to have proved that all velocity profiles are stable for all values of Reynolds' number. On the other hand, Tollmien has determined a critical value of Reynolds' number for the flow past a flat plate placed edgeways to the stream. This value is in good agreement with the experimental results. There are, however, certain points in his analysis which are not clear and it would be useful to know if the method gave results in agreement with those derived more strictly.},

	abstract = {The effect of an axial pressure gradient on the stability of viscous flow between rotating cylinders is discussed on the basis of the narrow gap approximation, the assumption of axisymmetric disturbances, and the assumption that the cylinders rotate in the same direction. The onset of instability then depends on both the Taylor number (
              T
              ) and the axial Reynolds number (R). For large values of R, the dominant mechanism of instability is of the Tollmien-Schlichting type and the present theory is based therefore on a generalization of the asymptotic methods of analysis that have been developed for the Orr-Sommerfeld equation. The present results, when combined with previous results for small values of R, give the complete stability boundary in the -plane. Only limited agreement is found with existing experimental data and it is suggested therefore that it may be necessary to consider either non-axisymmetric disturbances or nonlinear effects.},

The equations of motion of viscous fluid (obtained by grafting on certain terms to the abstract equations of the Eulerian form so as to adapt these equations to the case of fluids subject to stresses depending in some hypothetical manner on the rates of distortion, which equations Navier seems to have first introduced in 1822, and which were much studied by Cauchy and Poisson) were finally shown by St. Venant and Sir Gabriel Stokes, in 1845, to involve no other assumption than that the stresses, other than that of pressure uniform in all directions, are linear functions of the rates of distortion, with a co-efficient depending on the physical state of the fluid. By obtaining a singular solution of these equations as applied to the case of pendulums in steady periodic motion, Sir G. Stokes was able to compare the theoretical results with the numerous experiments that had been recorded, with the result that the theoretical calculations agreed so closely with the experimental determinations as seemingly to prove the truth of the assumption involved. This was also the result of comparing the flow of water through uniform tubes with the flow calculated from a singular solution of the equations so long as the tubes were small and the velocities slow. On the other hand, these results, both theoretical and practical, were directly at variance with common experience as to the resistance encountered by larger bodies moving with higher velocities through water, or by water moving with greater velocities through larger tubes. This discrepancy Sir G. Stokes considered as probably resulting from eddies which rendered the actual motion other than that to which the singular solution referred and not as disproving the assumption.},

            Shear flows undergo a sudden transition from laminar to turbulent motion as the velocity increases, and the onset of turbulence radically changes transport efficiency and mixing properties. Even for the well-studied case of pipe flow, it has not been possible to determine at what Reynolds number the motion will be either persistently turbulent or ultimately laminar. We show that in pipes, turbulence that is transient at low Reynolds numbers becomes sustained at a distinct critical point. Through extensive experiments and computer simulations, we were able to identify and characterize the processes ultimately responsible for sustaining turbulence. In contrast to the classical Landau-Ruelle-Takens view that turbulence arises from an increase in the temporal complexity of fluid motion, here, spatial proliferation of chaotic domains is the decisive process and intrinsic to the nature of fluid turbulence.},

In this paper an attempt is made to understand this phenomena by finding the linear three-dimensional perturbations that gain the most energy in a given time period. A complete set of perturbations, ordered by energy growth, is found using variational methods. The optimal perturbations are not of modal form, and those which grow the most resemble streamwise vortices, which divert the mean flow energy into streaks of streamwise velocity and enable the energy of the perturbation to grow by as much as three orders of magnitude. It is suggested that excitation of these perturbations facilitates transition from laminar to turbulent flow. The variational method used to find the optimal perturbations in a shear flow also allows construction of tight bounds on growth rate and determination of regions of absolute stability in which no perturbation growth is possible.},

To be sure, it is possible that in many experiments the disturbance is produced by the intervention of a mechanism that directly injects the requisite disturbance energy without calling on the store of kinetic energy inherent in the shear flow. It is shown here that it is also possible to tap the mean shear energy using properly configured perturbations that develop into the required primary disturbance on time scales comparable to those associated with the secondary instabilities even though the shear flow is stable or supports, at most, weak exponential instability.},

              Two new families of exact coherent states are found in plane Poiseuille flow. They are obtained from the stationary and the travelling-wave mirror-symmetric solutions in plane Couette flow by a homotopy continuation. They are characterized by the mirror symmetry inherited from those continued solutions in plane Couette flow. The first family arises from a saddle-node bifurcation and the second family bifurcates by breaking the top–bottom symmetry of the first family. We find that both families exist below the minimum saddle-node-point Reynolds number known to date (Waleffe,

One of these flows features two streak/vortex systems per spanwise wavelength, while the other features one such system. The former substantially reduces the value of the lowest Reynolds number at which channel flow solutions ,other than the basic flow, are known to exist down to 665. The third flow has, in contrast, half-turn rotational symmetry about a streamwise axis through a point on the channel centreplane, and is found to be the flow from which one of the asymmetric flows bifurcates in a symmetry-breaking bifurcation. This flow is found to exist on an isolated bifurcation branch, whose upper and lower branches both lie on the boundary basin separating initial conditions that lead to turbulent events, and those that directly decay back to laminar flow. The structure of this flow, in which the disturbance to the basic flow is concentrated in a core region in a spanwise period, allowed the derivation of a corresponding spanwise-localised flow, which is also discussed.},

              We study localised exact coherent structures in plane Poiseuille flow that are relative periodic orbits. They are obtained from extended states in smaller periodically continued domains, by increasing the length to obtain streamwise localisation and then by increasing the width to achieve spanwise localisation. The states maintain the travelling wave structure of the extended states, which is then modulated by a localised envelope on larger scales. In the streamwise direction, the envelope shows exponential localisation, with different exponents on the upstream and downstream sides. The upstream exponent increases linearly with Reynolds number

              . In the spanwise direction the decay is compatible with a power-law localisation. As the width increases the localised state undergoes further bifurcations which add additional unstable directions, so that the edge state, the relative attractor on the boundary between the laminar and turbulent motions, in the system becomes chaotic.},

streamwise vortices and low-velocity streaks; the other one, of gentle variation,

are unstable and the corresponding periodic orbits in the phase space are connected 
with each other. A turbulent state wanders around the strong one for most of the 
time except for occasional escapes from it. As a result, the mean velocity profile and 
the root-mean-squares of velocity fluctuations of the plane Couette turbulence agree 
very well with the temporal averages of those of this periodic motion. After an 
occasional escape from the strong solution, the turbulent state reaches the gentle periodic 
solution and returns. On the way back, it experiences an overshoot accompanied by 
strong turbulence activity like an intermittent bursting phenomenon.},

	abstract = {The phenomenon of bursting, in which streaks in turbulent boundary layers oscillate and then eject low-speed fluid away from the wall, has been studied experimentally, theoretically and computationally for more than 50 years because of its importance to the three-dimensional structure of turbulent boundary layers. Five new three-dimensional solutions of turbulent plane Couette flow are produced, one of which is periodic while the other four are relative periodic. Each of these five solutions demonstrates the breakup and re-formation of near-wall coherent structures. Four of our solutions are periodic, but with drifts in the streamwise direction. More surprisingly, two of our solutions are periodic, but with drifts in the spanwise direction, a possibility that does not seem to have been considered in the literature. It is argued that a considerable part of the streakiness observed experimentally in the near-wall region could be due to spanwise drifts that accompany the breakup and re-formation of coherent structures. A new periodic solution of plane Couette flow is also computed that could be related to transition to turbulence.
            The violent nature of the bursting phenomenon implies the need for good resolution in the computation of periodic and relative periodic solutions within turbulent shear flows. This computationally demanding requirement is addressed with a new algorithm for computing relative periodic solutions one of whose features is a combination of two well-known ideas – namely the Newton–Krylov iteration and the locally constrained optimal hook step. Each of the six solutions is accompanied by an error estimate.
            Dynamical principles are discussed that suggest that the bursting phenomenon, and more generally fluid turbulence, can be understood in terms of periodic and relative periodic solutions of the Navier–Stokes equation.},

              with the purpose of extracting simple invariant sets or ‘exact recurrent flows’ embedded in this turbulence. Each recurrent flow represents a sustained closed cycle of dynamical processes which underpins the turbulence. These are used to reconstruct the turbulence statistics using periodic orbit theory. The approach is found to be reasonably successful at a low value of the forcing where the flow is close to but not fully in its asymptotic (strongly) turbulent regime. Here, a total of 50 recurrent flows are found with the majority buried in the part of phase space most populated by the turbulence giving rise to a good reproduction of the energy and dissipation p.d.f. However, at higher forcing amplitudes now in the asymptotic turbulent regime, the generated turbulence data set proves insufficiently long to yield enough recurrent flows to make viable predictions. Despite this, the general approach seems promising providing enough simulation data is available since it is open to extensive automation and naturally generates dynamically important exact solutions for the flow.},

This boundary contains invariant dynamical states that are attracting when the dynamics is confined to the boundary. These states can be found by controlling a single quantity, in our case the energy content. The edge state is dominated by two downstream vortices and shows intrinsic chaotic dynamics. With increasing Reynolds number the separation between the edge state and turbulence increases. We can track it down to
              Re
              =1900, where the turbulent lifetimes are short enough that spontaneous decay can also be seen in experiments.},

	abstract = {The laminar–turbulent boundary Σ is the set separating initial conditions which relaminarize uneventfully from those which become turbulent. Phase space trajectories on this hypersurface in cylindrical pipe flow appear to be chaotic and show recurring evidence of coherent structures. A general numerical technique is developed for recognizing approaches to these structures and then for identifying the exact coherent solutions themselves. Numerical evidence is presented which suggests that trajectories on Σ are organized around only a few travelling waves and their heteroclinic connections. If the flow is suitably constrained to a subspace with a discrete rotational symmetry, it is possible to find locally attracting travelling waves embedded within Σ. Four new types of travelling waves were found using this approach.},

	abstract = {The recent theoretical discovery of finite-amplitude travelling waves (TWs) in pipe flow has reignited interest in the transitional phenomena that Osborne Reynolds studied 125 years ago. Despite all being unstable, these waves are providing fresh insight into the flow dynamics. We describe two new classes of TWs, which, while possessing more restrictive symmetries than previously found TWs of Faisst \& Eckhardt (2003

              , 333–371), seem to be more fundamental to the hierarchy of exact solutions. They exhibit much higher wall shear stresses and appear at notably lower Reynolds numbers. The first M-class comprises the various discrete rotationally symmetric analogues of the mirror-symmetric wave found in Pringle \& Kerswell (2007

The second N-class has the more familiar separation of fast streaks to the exterior and slow streaks to the interior and looks like the precursor to the class of non-mirror-symmetric waves already known.},
