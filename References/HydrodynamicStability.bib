	abstract = {In recent work it has been shown that there can be substantial transient growth in the energy of small perturbations to plane Poiseuille and Couette flows if the Reynolds number is below the critical value predicted by linear stability analysis. This growth, which may be as large as
              O
              (1000), occurs in the absence of nonlinear effects and can be explained by the non-normality of the governing linear operator - that is, the non-orthogonality of the associated eigenfunctions. In this paper we study various aspects of this energy growth for two- and three-dimensional Poiseuille and Couette flows using energy methods, linear stability analysis, and a direct numerical procedure for computing the transient growth. We examine conditions for no energy growth, the dependence of the growth on the streamwise and spanwise wavenumbers, the time dependence of the growth, and the effects of degenerate eigenvalues. We show that the maximum transient growth behaves like
              O
              (
              R
              2
              ), where
              R
              is the Reynolds number. We derive conditions for no energy growth by applying the Hille–Yosida theorem to the governing linear operator and show that these conditions yield the same results as those derived by energy methods, which can be applied to perturbations of arbitrary amplitude. These results emphasize the fact that subcritical transition can occur for Poiseuille and Couette flows because the governing linear operator is non-normal.},

Though they have slightly larger growths than two-dimensional cases, they are broadly similar in character. When the inflow of the full nonlinear system is perturbed with white noise, narrowband random velocity perturbations are observed in the downstream channel at locations corresponding to maximum linear transient growth. The centre frequency of this response matches that computed from the streamwise wavelength and mean advection speed of the predicted optimal disturbance. Linkage between the response of the driven flow and the optimal disturbance is further demonstrated by a partition of response energy into velocity components.},

              element discretization using a hybrid mesh. Steady basic states are investigated by solution of the partial-derivative eigenvalue problem, while Floquet theory is used to analyse time-periodic flow set-up past the first bifurcation. The leading mode is associated with the wake and long-wavelength perturbations, while a second short-wavelength mode can be associated with the separation bubble at the trailing edge. The leading eigenvalues and Floquet multipliers of the LPT flow have been obtained in a range of spanwise wavenumbers. For the most general configuration all secondary modes were observed to be stable in the Reynolds number regime considered. When a single LPT blade with top to bottom periodicity is considered as a base flow, the imposed periodicity forces the wakes of adjacent blades to be synchronized. This enforced synchronization can produce a linear instability due to long-wavelength disturbances. However, relaxing the periodic restrictions is shown to remove this instability. A pseudo-spectrum analysis shows that the eigenvalues can become unstable due to the non-orthogonal properties of the eigenmodes. Three-dimensional direct numerical simulations confirm all perturbations identified herein.

In the three decades since it ﬁrst appeared in the literature, global instability analysis, based on the solution of the multidimensional eigenvalue and/or initial value problem, is continuously broadening both in scope and in depth. To date it has dealt successfully with a wide range of applications arising in aerospace engineering, physiological ﬂows, food processing, and nuclear-reactor safety. In recent years, nonmodal analysis has complemented the more traditional modal approach and increased knowledge of ﬂow instability physics. Recent highlights delivered by the application of either modal or nonmodal global analysis are brieﬂy discussed. A conscious effort is made to demystify both the tools currently utilized and the jargon employed to describe them, demonstrating the simplicity of the analysis. Hopefully this will provide new impulses for the creation of next-generation algorithms capable of coping with the main open research areas in which step-change progress can be expected by the application of the theory: instability analysis of fully inhomogeneous, 3D ﬂows and control thereof.},

The technique can be used to identify the most eﬃcient way to disturb a system such that it transits from one stable state to another. The key idea is introduced within the framework of a ﬁnite-dimensional set of ordinary diﬀerential equations (ODEs) and then illustrated for a very simple system of 2 ODEs which possesses bistability. Then the transition to turbulence problem in ﬂuid mechanics is used to show how the technique can be formulated for a spatially-extended system described by a partial diﬀerential equation (the well-known Navier-Stokes equation). Within that context, the optimisation technique bridges the gap between (linear) optimal perturbation theory and the (nonlinear) dynamical systems approach to ﬂuid ﬂows. The fact that the technique has now been recently shown to work in this very high dimensional setting augurs well for its utility in other physical systems.},

When coupled with a search over the disturbance amplitude, this can reveal the disturbance of least amplitude—called the minimal seed—for transition to another state such as turbulence. The approach bridges the theoretical gap between (linear) nonmodal theory and the (nonlinear) dynamical systems approach to ﬂuid ﬂows by allowing one to explore phase space at a ﬁnite distance from the reference ﬂow state.

	abstract = {The turbulence problem is still unsolved, through a number of valuable papers have been published on it comparatively recently. But, since Hopf and von Mises proved that uniform shearing motion between two parallel planes was stable for infinitesimal disturbances but unstable for disturbances of a finite size has become more and more widely held. Von mises suggested that the reoughness of the walls might be the determining factor, but the experiments of Schiller have shown that the degree of roughness of the walls is of negligible influence on the critical value of Reynold's number. He concluded that the breakdown of laminar flow depended primarily on the size of the initial disturbance, in agreement eith Osborne Reynold's view. Important papers have been published by Noether and Tollmien, whose conclusions are in contradiction to one another. On the one hand, Noether, by a formal investigation of the asymptotic solutions of the equation governing the two-dimensional disturbances of flow between parallel walls, claims to have proved that all velocity profiles are stable for all values of Reynolds' number. On the other hand, Tollmien has determined a critical value of Reynolds' number for the flow past a flat plate placed edgeways to the stream. This value is in good agreement with the experimental results. There are, however, certain points in his analysis which are not clear and it would be useful to know if the method gave results in agreement with those derived more strictly.},

	abstract = {The effect of an axial pressure gradient on the stability of viscous flow between rotating cylinders is discussed on the basis of the narrow gap approximation, the assumption of axisymmetric disturbances, and the assumption that the cylinders rotate in the same direction. The onset of instability then depends on both the Taylor number (
              T
              ) and the axial Reynolds number (R). For large values of R, the dominant mechanism of instability is of the Tollmien-Schlichting type and the present theory is based therefore on a generalization of the asymptotic methods of analysis that have been developed for the Orr-Sommerfeld equation. The present results, when combined with previous results for small values of R, give the complete stability boundary in the -plane. Only limited agreement is found with existing experimental data and it is suggested therefore that it may be necessary to consider either non-axisymmetric disturbances or nonlinear effects.},

	abstract = {1. The equations of motion of viscous fluid (obtained by grafting on certain terms to the abstract equations of the Eulerian form so as to adapt these equations to the case of fluids subject to stresses depending in some hypothetical manner on the rates of distortion, which equations Navier seems to have first introduced in 1822, and which were much studied by Cauchy and Poisson) were finally shown by St. Venant and Sir Gabriel Stokes, in 1845, to involve no other assumption than that the stresses, other than that of pressure uniform in all directions, are linear functions of the rates of distortion, with a co-efficient depending on the physical state of the fluid. By obtaining a singular solution of these equations as applied to the case of pendulums in steady periodic motion, Sir G. Stokes was able to compare the theoretical results with the numerous experiments that had been recorded, with the result that the theoretical calculations agreed so closely with the experimental determinations as seemingly to prove the truth of the assumption involved. This was also the result of comparing the flow of water through uniform tubes with the flow calculated from a singular solution of the equations so long as the tubes were small and the velocities slow. On the other hand, these results, both theoretical and practical, were directly at variance with common experience as to the resistance encountered by larger bodies moving with higher velocities through water, or by water moving with greater velocities through larger tubes. This discrepancy Sir G. Stokes considered as probably resulting from eddies which rendered the actual motion other than that to which the singular solution referred and not as disproving the assumption.},
