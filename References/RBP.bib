	abstract = {In studying the stability of a thermally stratified fluid in the presence of a viscous shear flow, we have a situation in which there is an important interaction between the mechanism of instability due to the stratification and the Tollmien-Schlichting mechanism due to the shear. A complete analysis has been carried out for the Bénard problem in the presence of a plane Poiseuille flow and it is shown that, although Squire's transformation can be used to reduce the three-dimensional problem to an equivalent two-dimensional one, a theorem of Squire's type does not follow unless the Richardson number exceeds a certain small negative value. This conclusion follows from the fact that, when the stratification is unstable and the Prandtl number is unity, the equivalent two-dimensional problem becomes identical mathematically to the stability problem for spiral flow between rotating cylinders and, from the known results for the spiral flow problem, Squire's transformation can then be used to obtain the complete three-dimensional stability boundary. For the case of stable stratification, however, Squire's theorem is valid and the instability is of the usual Tollmien—Schlichting type. Additional calculations have been made for this case which show that the flow is completely stabilized when the Richardson number exceeds a certain positive value.},

At first, the linear stability analysis by Clever and Busse [JFM, 1991] in the case of PRB flows between two infinite plates is extended to the case of confined channels with a 10 transversal aspect ratio. In the second part, using 3D non linear direct numerical simulations, the space and time development of the chaotic wavy rolls obtained by maintaining a permanent random excitation at channel inlet is analyzed. As the perturbation is designed to cover all the modes, it is possible to detect the modes that are naturally amplified by the flow and those that are damped. It is shown that the wavy roll characteristics obtained in this way vary a lot with Ra increasing and stabilize for Ra{\textgreater}3Ra*. Comparisons with the experiments by Pabiou et al. [JFM, 2005] are proposed.},

	abstract = {It is demonstrated that a signiﬁcant drag reduction for pressure-driven ﬂows can be realized by applying spatially distributed heating. The heating creates separation bubbles that separate the stream from the bounding walls and, at the same time, alter the distribution of the Reynolds stress, thereby providing a propulsive force. The strength of this effect is of practical interest for heating with wavenumbers α = O(1) and for ﬂows with small Reynolds numbers and, thus, it is of potential interest for applications in micro-channels. Explicit results given for a very simple sinusoidal heating demonstrate that the drag-reducing effect increases proportionally to the second power of the heating intensity. This increase saturates if the heating becomes too intense. Drag reduction decreases as α4 when the heating wavenumber becomes too small, and as α−7 when the heating wavenumber becomes too large; this decrease is due to the reduction in the magnitude of the Reynolds stress. The drag reduction can reach up to 87 \% for the heating intensities of interest and heating patterns corresponding to the most effective heating wavenumber.},

The maximum optimal transient growth Gmax of streamwise-uniform disturbances increases slowly with increasing Ra and decreasing Pr.

For the Reynolds numbers lower than 80 with a large computational domain of 51.2 × 2 × 22.5, the turbulent puff was observed and its signiﬁcant inﬂuences on the momentum and heat transports were found. The spatial structure of the equilibrium puff, or the localized turbulence, was examined with taking account of two different thermal boundary conditions: the uniform heat-ﬂux heating and the constant temperature difference between the walls. It was revealed that there existed a localized strong turbulent region in the form of an oblique band, along which a spanwise secondary ﬂow was induced. In consequence, at the present lowest Reynolds number as low as 60, the ﬂow remained turbulent and the larger Nusselt numbers than those without puff was obtained by the presence of puff.},

Our focus is on deviations from the logarithmic law of the wall due to buoyant motion. The effects of convection in the relevant ranges are discussed, providing measurements of mean proﬁles of velocity, temperature and Reynolds stresses as well as of the friction coefﬁcient.

	abstract = {Flow in a horizontal channel exposed to external heating which results in sinusoidal temperature variations along the upper and lower walls with a phase shift between them has been studied using a combination of analytical and numerical methods. The most intense convection is observed when the upper and lower hot spots are located above each other. It has been demonstrated that the heating results in a signiﬁcant reduction of the pressure gradient required to drive the ﬂow when compared to a similar ﬂow in an isothermal channel. The drag reduction is associated with the formation of separation bubbles which insulate the stream from direct contact with the bounding walls. The ﬂuid inside of the bubbles rotates due to horizontal density gradients, which further reduces the required pressure gradient. The magnitude of the drag reduction depends on the phase shift between the heating patterns and can increase by up to threefold when compared to the drag reduction which can be achieved by heating only one wall. A detailed analysis of the associated heat ﬂuxes has been presented.},

	abstract = {This paper reports on a theoretical analysis of the rich variety of spatio-temporal patterns observed recently in inclined layer convection at medium Prandtl number when varying the inclination angle \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ and the Rayleigh number \$R\$. The present numerical investigation of the inclined layer convection system is based on the standard Oberbeck-Boussinesq equations. The patterns are shown to originate from a complicated competition of buoyancy-driven and shear-flow driven pattern forming mechanisms. The former are expressed as {\textbackslash}rm\{longitudinal\} convection rolls with their axes oriented parallel to the incline, the latter as perpendicular {\textbackslash}rm\{transverse\} rolls. Along with conventional methods to study roll patterns and their stability, we employ direct numerical simulations in large spatial domains, comparable with the experimental ones. As a result, we determine the phase diagram of the characteristic complex 3D convection patterns above onset of convection in the \${\textbackslash}gamma-R\$ plane, and find that it compares very well with the experiments. In particular we demonstrate that interactions of specific Fourier modes, characterized by a resonant interaction of their wavevectors in the layer plane, are key to understanding the pattern morphologies.},

	abstract = {We report on a high-fidelity, spectral/hp element algorithm developed for the direct numerical simulation of thermal convection problems. We consider the incompressible Navier–Stokes (NS) and advection–diffusion equations coupled through a thermal body-forcing term. The flow is driven by a prescribed flowrate forcing with explicit treatment of the nonlinear advection terms. The explicit treatment of the body-force term also decouples both the NS and the advection–diffusion equations. The problem is then temporally discretized using an implicit–explicit scheme in conjunction with a velocity-correction splitting scheme to decouple the velocity and pressure fields in the momentum equation. Although not unique, this type of discretization has not been widely applied to thermal convection problems and we therefore provide a comprehensive overview of the algorithm and implementation which is available through the open-source package Nektar++. After verifying the algorithm on a number of illustrative problems we then apply the code to investigate flow in a channel with uniform or streamwise sinusoidal lower wall, in addition to a patterned sinusoidal heating. We verify the solver against previously published two-dimensional results. Finally, for the first time we consider a three-dimensional problem with a streamwise sinusoidal lower wall and sinusoidal heating which, for the chosen parameter, leads to the unusual dynamics of an initially unsteady two-dimensional instability leading to a steady three-dimensional nonlinear saturated state.},

	abstract = {Pressure-gradient-driven flows in grooved horizontal channels were investigated. The results show that a significant reduction in pressure losses can be achieved by exposing such channels to spatially distributed heating. The system response strongly depends on the characterization of both patterns and on their relative position, leading to a pattern interaction problem. Mismatch and misplacement of both patterns may result in a significant increase in pressure losses or may have no effect on such losses. The reduction in pressure loss is associated with the formation of convection rolls on the bounding surfaces due to spatially distributed buoyancy along the streamwise direction. The pressuregradient-reducing effect is active only in small Reynolds number flows. Explicit results are given for fluids with the Prandtl number Pr = 0.71, representing air.},
