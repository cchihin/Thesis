Non-linear properties such as the dependence of the heat transport on Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers and the stability properties of convection rolls are emphasised in the discussion. Whenever possible, theoretical results are compared with experimental observations. A section on convection in rotating systems has been included, but the influence of other additional physical effects such as magnetic fields, side wall geometry, etc., has not been considered.}

abstract = {Nektar++ is an open-source software framework designed to support the development of high-performance scalable solvers for partial differential equations using the spectral/hp element method. High-order methods are gaining prominence in several engineering and biomedical applications due to their improved accuracy over low-order techniques at reduced computational cost for a given number of degrees of freedom. However, their proliferation is often limited by their complexity, which makes these methods challenging to implement and use. Nektar++ is an initiative to overcome this limitation by encapsulating the mathematical complexities of the underlying method within an efficient C++ framework, making the techniques more accessible to the broader scientific and industrial communities. The software supports a variety of discretisation techniques and implementation strategies, supporting methods research as well as application-focused computation, and the multi-layered structure of the framework allows the user to embrace as much or as little of the complexity as they need. The libraries capture the mathematical constructs of spectral/hp element methods, while the associated collection of pre-written PDE solvers provides out-of-the-box application-level functionality and a template for users who wish to develop solutions for addressing questions in their own scientific domains.

abstract = {Abstract We report on a high-fidelity, spectral/hp element algorithm developed for the direct numerical simulation of thermal convection problems. We consider the incompressible Navier–Stokes (NS) and advection–diffusion equations coupled through a thermal body-forcing term. The flow is driven by a prescribed flowrate forcing with explicit treatment of the nonlinear advection terms. The explicit treatment of the body-force term also decouples both the NS and the advection–diffusion equations. The problem is then temporally discretized using an implicit–explicit scheme in conjunction with a velocity-correction splitting scheme to decouple the velocity and pressure fields in the momentum equation. Although not unique, this type of discretization has not been widely applied to thermal convection problems and we therefore provide a comprehensive overview of the algorithm and implementation which is available through the open-source package Nektar++. After verifying the algorithm on a number of illustrative problems we then apply the code to investigate flow in a channel with uniform or streamwise sinusoidal lower wall, in addition to a patterned sinusoidal heating. We verify the solver against previously published two-dimensional results. Finally, for the first time we consider a three-dimensional problem with a streamwise sinusoidal lower wall and sinusoidal heating which, for the chosen parameter, leads to the unusual dynamics of an initially unsteady two-dimensional instability leading to a steady three-dimensional nonlinear saturated state.},

In addition to the classical problem of a horizontal stationary fluid layer heated from below, it also briefly covers convection in such a layer with rotation about a vertical axis, with inclination, and with modulation of the vertical acceleration. }

                This chapter discusses the onset and development of thermal convection in fully developed shear flows. The subject of thermal convection in shear flows is rich in results that have both basic interest and practical importance in science and engineering. Although the field has matured greatly during the part 15 years, many topics still need study. For instance, the effects of channel sidewalls on both the initial instability and the instability of longitudinal rolls need to be clarified both theoretically and experimentally. More effort should be devoted to the use of controlled disturbances in studying the onset of instability due to the convective nature of the instability. Such studies might prove useful also in suggesting how turbulent convection can be promoted or postponed in shear flows. This chapter presents an in-depth account of the basic concepts and of some of the major results that have occurred during the past 15 years. It focuses primarily on simple basic states involving a Boussinesq fluid and fully developed forced flows, mainly of the Couette or Poiseuille type. The chapter also provides some references to similar phenomena in other basic flows, for example, when the basic flow itself is due to natural (or “free”) convection.}

This new type of instability, whose originality is to arise within a macroscopically fluctuating state, can be described in the framework of Ginzburg–Landau equations to which noise is heuristically added to take into account the intrinsic fluctuations of the basic state.}

    abstract = {The lifetimes of injected jet puffs are used to determine the critical point at which turbulent pipe flow is sustained. Shear flows undergo a sudden transition from laminar to turbulent motion as the velocity increases, and the onset of turbulence radically changes transport efficiency and mixing properties. Even for the well-studied case of pipe flow, it has not been possible to determine at what Reynolds number the motion will be either persistently turbulent or ultimately laminar. We show that in pipes, turbulence that is transient at low Reynolds numbers becomes sustained at a distinct critical point. Through extensive experiments and computer simulations, we were able to identify and characterize the processes ultimately responsible for sustaining turbulence. In contrast to the classical Landau-Ruelle-Takens view that turbulence arises from an increase in the temporal complexity of fluid motion, here, spatial proliferation of chaotic domains is the decisive process and intrinsic to the nature of fluid turbulence.}

    abstract = "{Turbulent-laminar banded patterns in plane Poiseuille flow are studied via direct numerical simulations in a tilted and translating computational domain using a parallel version of the pseudospectral code Channelflow. 3D visualizations via the streamwise vorticity of an instantaneous and a time-averaged pattern are presented, as well as 2D visualizations of the average velocity field and the turbulent kinetic energy. Simulations for 2300 ⩾ Reb ⩾ 700 show the gradual development from uniform turbulence to a pattern with wavelength 20 half-gaps at Reb ≈ 1900, to a pattern with wavelength 40 at Reb ≈ 1300 and finally to laminar flow at Reb ≈ 800. These transitions are tracked quantitatively via diagnostics using the amplitude and phase of the Fourier transform and its probability distribution. The propagation velocity of the pattern is approximately that of the mean flux and is a decreasing function of Reynolds number. Examination of the time-averaged flow shows that a turbulent band is associated with two counter-rotating cells stacked in the cross-channel direction and that the turbulence is highly concentrated near the walls. Near the wall, the Reynolds stress force accelerates the fluid through a turbulent band while viscosity decelerates it; advection by the laminar profile acts in both directions. In the center, the Reynolds stress force decelerates the fluid through a turbulent band while advection by the laminar profile accelerates it. These characteristics are compared with those of turbulent-laminar banded patterns in plane Couette flow.}",

    abstract="We have seen that under certain conditions, in the case of weak instability, the perturbation approaches in the limit as t {\textrightarrow} ∞ a periodic solution of permanent type, of small and finite amplitude. However, on the basis of the analysis of Chapter 7 we can only conclude that this periodic permanent-type solution represents the limit of perturbations which are also periodic at the initial instant. On the other hand, we have already emphasized that in a proper formulation of the stability problem general aperiodic perturbations must be studied. Thus we should consider initial conditions such that Фk≠ 0 for all values of k. The analysis of the preceding chapter is then simply not applicable.",

    abstract="It is well known that the Navier-Stokes equation of motion for a homogeneous incompressible fluid has a unique stationary solution, if the body forces acting on the fluid and the prescribed values of the velocity at the boundary are sufficiently small. We shall call this solution the primary solution. While the primary solution is a possible solution for all values of the prescribed parameters, it is not unique anymore when the parameters exceed certain critical values. The simplest kind of nonuniqueness is caused by stationary secondary solutions for which the principle of exchange of stability holds, i.e. the secondary solution branching off the primary solution becomes stable in place of the primary solution for values of the relevant parameter beyond the critical branching point. Physically this process corresponds to the appearance of a secondary motion superimposed onto the primary state of the fluid system. The secondary motion is usually char-acterized by a typical scale which is not shown by the primary state and which is exhibited in the form of a cell-like subdivision of the flow field. It is for this reason that the secondary motion for which the principle of exchange of stability holds has been called cellular flow.",
