We show that the rotational form provides improved error estimates in terms of the H1-norm for the velocity and of the L2-norm for the pressure. We also show that the class of fractional-step methods introduced in [S. A. Orsag, M. Israeli, and M. Deville, J. Sci. Comput., 1 (1986), pp. 75–111] and [K. E. Karniadakis, M. Israeli, and S. A.

Thus, to the best of our knowledge, our results provide the ﬁrst rigorous proof of stability and convergence of the methods in those papers. We also emphasize that, contrary to those of the above groups, our formulations are set in the standard L2 setting, and consequently they can be easily implemented by means of any variational approximation techniques, in particular the ﬁnite element methods.},

	abstract = {General linear methods, as multistage multivalue methods, are the natural generalizations of linear multistep and Runge-Kutta methods. This survey contains a discussion of the traditional methods and a motivation for the general linear type of generalization. The new methods are introduced in terms of their formulation and the basic properties of consistency, stability and convergence. The order of general linear methods has to be looked at from a new point of view and it is shown how to use an algebraic structure (equivalent to B-series) to express conditions for a given order. Linear and non-linear stability for the new methods brings the theories for the classical methods into a comprehensive formulation and known results are outlined. Recently a number of subfamilies have been introduced and some of these are considered in detail. This applies in particular to methods with the property known as ‘inherent Runge-Kutta stability’. These seem to have prospects of yielding useful and efficient methods, and some progress towards their practical implementation is outlined. Finally, the relationship between stability functions and order of methods is discussed in a setting wide enough to include general linear methods as well as multiderivative methods, such as Obreshkov methods. The classical barriers due to Ehle, Daniel-Moore and Dahlquist (second barrier) all fit into a common pattern and these are explored in a general setting.},

Parallel computers with large storage capacities are paving the way for high-resolution simulations of coupled problems; however, hardware improvements alone will not prove enough to enable simulations based on brute-force algorithmic approaches. To accurately capture nonlinear couplings between dynamically relevant phenomena, often while stepping over rapid adjustments to quasi-equilibria, simulation scientists are increasingly turning to implicit formulations that require a discrete nonlinear system to be solved for each time step or steady state solution. Recent advances in iterative methods have made fully implicit formulations a viable option for solution of these large-scale problems. In this paper, we overview one of the most eﬀective iterative methods, Newton-Krylov, for nonlinear systems and point to software packages with its implementation. We illustrate the method with an example from magnetically conﬁned plasma fusion and brieﬂy survey other areas in which implicit methods have bestowed important advantages, such as allowing high-order temporal integration and providing a pathway to sensitivity analyses and optimization. Lastly, we overview algorithm extensions under development motivated by current SciDAC applications.},

First, the underlying mathematical treatment in primitive ﬂow variables is presented.

The formulation makes use of splitting methods, which means that it can be wrapped around an existing time-stepping code as a “black box.” The method is first applied to a scalar problem in order to analyse its stability and highlight the roles of the control coefficient χ and the filter width Δ in the convergence (or not) towards the steady-state. Then the steady-state of the incompressible flow past a two-dimensional cylinder at Re = 100, obtained with a code which implements the spectral/hp element method, is presented.},

However, this method has two main limitations: it does not converge for arbitrary control parameters, and when it does converge, the time necessary to reach a steady-state solution may be very long. In this paper, we present an adaptive algorithm to address these two issues. We show that by evaluating the dominant eigenvalue of a “partially converged” steady flow, we can select a control coefficient and a filter width that ensure an optimum convergence of the SFD method. We apply this adaptive method to several classical test cases of computational fluid dynamics and we show that a steady-state solution can be obtained with a very limited (or without any) a priori knowledge of the flow stability properties.},
